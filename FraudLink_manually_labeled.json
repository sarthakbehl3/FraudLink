Inevitably, this crash will evoke disillusionment in the technology & the space.Earlier this week,FTX, a top crypto exchange became insolvent. Recently valued at $24b, FTX is the third major crypto company to collapse in 2022 due to insolvency:Three Arrows Capital&Terracomplete the trio.In these three cases, each used cryptocurrency as collateral. When the collateral\u2019s value disintegrated, the business defaulted. FTX\u2019s trading arm, Alameda, borrowed against FTX\u2019s token called FTT. Terra used their currency Luna to maintain a peg for their stablecoin UST. Three Arrows borrowed against their crypto holdings to invest in Luna & defaulted on their loans when Luna crashed in value.In addition, hackers have stolen more than$2.3b of assetsfrom projects year-to-date.The rotten cherry atop this mud pie: across the top 100 crypto projects, the typical token has lost 75% of its value since January.Those are rough stats. But broad rejection of the advances is as myopic as unmitigated zealotry for the innovations of web3.Carlota Perez\u2019s Technological Revolutions & Financial Capital lends some perspective on this crypto winter. BothBen Thompson&Jerry Neumannhave great overviews of the book.In short, technology advances have an installation phase when frenzy for an innovation drives speculative investment, with periods punctuated by rapture & collapse. Web3 remains in the installation phase when a technology exists & the promise of many new businesses outshines the reality. These cycles take 50 years & we\u2019re about a decade into web3.The aftershocks of these three foundation-shaking earthquakes in crypto will include regulatory oversight, weaker investor interest, & broader skepticism which are healthy advances.Protecting consumer dollars with regulation reinforces credibility in financial institutions. Fewer dollars in the ecosystem will focus builders on viable business models.Investors will value these companies based on revenues.We\u2019ve been here before. \u201cAll of the money poured into tech companies in the first half decade of the Internet Era created an infrastructure and economic foundation that would allow the internet to mature.The dotcom bubble created several multi-trillion dollar companies twenty years later.That gloom will continue to cast over the ecosystem until a founding team figures out a way to assemble decentralized databases, tokenomics, wallets, & NFTs into a product that changes the world.","14":" Blessings on the Feast Day of Saint Agnes of Assisi \u2026 \u201cSaint Agnes of Assisi In front of San Damiano ... Painting by Dino Carbetta\u201d \u2026 When St Clare received the veil in 1212, she left a young sister of fourteen named Agnes behind her at home. In answer to Clare's prayers and inspired by God, Agnes left for the same convent only 16 days later. Saint Francis gave Clare\u2019s sister the name Agnes because she was gentle like a young lamb. St Francis then led the two maidens to St Damian's convent, where he also gave the holy habit to Agnes. She now endeavored to imitate her saintly sister in everything and devoted all her spare time to prayer and contemplation. She lived a very austere life, partaking only of bread and water, and wearing coarse clothing. St Francis soon recognized the rich treasure of virtue hidden in this privileged soul. When a new convent was to be founded in Florence, St Francis sent Agnes, despite her youth. Saint Agnes of Assisi was favored with many extraordinary graces by God. In the great fervor of her devotion, she often elevated above the earth. From Holy Thursday until Holy Saturday she was once so found in rapture in the contemplation of the sufferings of Christ that she was under the impression she had spent only an hour in this mystical state. Agnes matched her sister in devotion to prayer and in willingness to endure the strict penances that characterized the Poor Ladies\u2019 lives at San Damiano. When a group of Benedictine nuns in Monticelli asked to become Poor Ladies, Clare sent Agnes to become abbess of the monastery. Agnes soon wrote a rather sad letter about how much she missed Clare and the other nuns at San Damiano. After establishing monasteries in northern Italy, Agnes was recalled to San Damiano in 1253, as Clare lay dying. In her last moments Clare addressed her sister in these words, \"My beloved sister, it is the will of God that I go, but be comforted, you will soon come and rejoin me with our Lord.\" Three months later Agnes followed her sister to eternity on November 16, 1253.

It is the fourth studio album from Deep Purple since Steve Morse joined the band in 1994 and the second to feature veteran keyboardist Don Airey. The album was produced by Mike Bradford, who also produced the band's previous release, Bananas. It's the second release from the re-energized lineup of vocalist Ian Gillan, guitarist Steve Morse, bass guitarist Roger Glover, drummer Ian Paice, and keyboardist Don Airey, who replaced the retired Jon Lord.\"Money Talks,\" \"Girls Like That,\" and \"Wrong Man\" ride strong riffs and rhythms into decent grooves. \"Rapture of the Deep\" floats along on a lightly hypnotic wave. The mature ballad \"Clearly Quite Absurd\" has a lilting, controlled tempo, and it's the biggest surprise on the album; Gillan's singing is appropriately subdued while Airey's piano supplies the beauty and Morse's gradually ascending riffs toward the end build the tension. \"MTV\" is a vicious, bile-spewing, all-out attack on how the modern music industry treats classic rock\/heritage artists, although in 2005 Deep Purple clearly appeals more to VH1 Classic than MTV. Initially, the song risks biting the hand that feeds by correctly criticizing classic rock radio for not playing new music by veteran artists.

Try #PONO from my esteemed colleague and fellow Limitless Minds Room Tilter, Krista Ryan, PCC. P: Pause and take 3 x deep belly breaths (from your diaphragm). Use your built in regulator. Remove yourself from the environment to change your sensory inputs\/outputs. Go to the restroom, snack bar, car for a few moments to gather yourself. O: Observe. Your thoughts, emotions and behaviors objectively as possible. Accept them for what they are and name them to tame them. Imagine them as characters rising the bus of your mind where you are the driver. Ask yourself: Which of these characters is helping or hurting you right now? N: Neutral thinking. Shift from negative thinking and\/or unrealistic positive thinking for more effective neutral thinking. Allow unhelpful thoughts and emotions to get of your mind bus. O: Onward. Take the next best step toward a small victory. Sometimes that means just shutting up and enjoying the game. Let the kids play, the coaches coach and the referees ref.

What started a few weeks previously as slight pain down the outer back of my right leg turned into excruciating pain seemingly overnight. Sitting up was unbearable to the point where I had to cancel all of my plans and spend the rest of the day bedridden. I thought everyone was joking when they told me that life was all downhill after I turned 25 ;)After a few hard days of not knowing what was wrong, my MRI came back and revealed I had a severe disc L5-S1 disc herniation. Confused, I asked the doctor how could this happen? He explained that disk herniations are sustained pressure over a long period on the disc annulus which by itself causes no pain. Eventually, the jelly-like center of the disc raptures the wall and pushes on the spinal nerves which causes debilitating pain. He said for back injuries, my experience is very common. Small acts like bad posture, poor sleeping position, and improper weightlifting form compound over time to result in herniation.This experience taught me firsthand the power of little everyday actions and 1% changes. I learned that everything we do, no matter how insignificant, will have an impact if repeated over time. It taught me that massive change in life is almost always brought by small and simple actions compounded over time and not one big event. Over the past year,little acts like sitting with good posture, walking every morning, physical therapy, reading a book before bed at night, and making space for meditation and self-reflection every day had a profound impact on my life. I saw firsthand that a 1% improvement compounded every week results in a 167% improvement over a year.Not being able to walk or sleep well at night for 3 months was the most challenging event in my life so far. I am grateful for Microsoft who allowed me the flexibility to take space as well as work from bed for a while. As I sit here exactly one year later, I can't help but reflect on how different today is - even though I have not fully recovered. While I wouldn't wish this situation on anyone, I am grateful for the trial and the person I have become as a result.","27":"Bird week continues.... \"Raptor Rapture\" PRINTS:  #art #artist #marleneburns #birds #painting #abstractart #contemporaryart #painting #artprints","28":"Jeremiah 15:19 - Therefore, thus says the Lord, if you return, then I will restore you - before Me you will stand ...

Yesterday I lost a friend, Dave Sarsfield.  He was more than a friend, he was one of my first bosses at McAfee.  We first met on the 3rd floor at McAfee and bonded over our affinity for Big Ten football.I didn\u2019t fault him for being a Badgers fan, he was moderately ok with me being a Buckeye.  If you ever mentioned the word football, he would instantly (and proudly) tell you he was an \u2018owner\u2019 with the Green Bay Packers.  That first year I met him, his beloved packers beat the Pittsburg Squealers in the Super Bowl\u2026 With the Monday after, you would have thought he threw the game winning touchdown with the size of the smile on his face.Two days before the Super Bowl, we had a massive (ok, massive for Texas) snowstorm hit Dallas.  I remember the city and many of the residents thinking it was the literal RAPTURE hitting our city.  For an Ohio boy, the empty streets were my playground.  I drove to work that morning, and there were three cars in our parking lot.  Naturally, I made \u2018artwork\u2019 in the snow care of some carefully crafted donuts in my little Volkswagen.  I proudly strutted to my desk, and there was Sars, looking out the window at the parking lot.\u201cThat your handy work Wendel?\u201d\u201cYes sir\u201d\u201cNice!  Let\u2019s get to work\u201dI learned a lot that year from Sars.  He also reminded me of a few things I had already learned, but needed reinforcement on.- Repetition is the mother of learning,- Ad libbing is for amateurs,- The only thing you can control is how much work you put into it,- And my favorite, RTFE.I took those lessons and did my best to continue to use them as I grew with McAfee.Sars continued to grow the SMB team into a perennially quota crushing, fun loving group.  After moving to Chicago, my trips back to the Plano office were always met with a giant bear hug and an \u201cI miss you brother\u201d, \u201cHow\u2019s that beautiful wife and handsome son?\u201d, along with a handful of jokes I can\u2019t share here, from Sars.

I opined that what we humans seek, more than a meaning for life, are experiences that remind us what it feels like to be alive. These are more than feel-good moments; RAPTURE as an emotion is more akin to GRATITUDE or WONDER. Experiences of rapture open us up, they invite vulnerability, and they make us more freely available to others. We are more able to approach life with a wide open heart.Four days ago, I had a day filled with such moments as I completed the Boulder Skyline Traverse with Bart Foster and 40 incredible business leaders \/ outdoor adventurists. I feel deeply grateful to have been invited, especially for the opportunity to connect with other humans through physical challenge and intentional conversation.#BusinessOutsideGreg Keith Robin Thurston Jared Hanley Holli Owen Aaron Houghton Carla Mack, OD, MBA, FAAO, FBCLA Paul Warner Godard Abel Paul P.

I further wish to specialize in epigenetics and explore the recent techniques of #crisprcas9  and #cartcelltherapy, both of which Penn has to offer a promising future.#upenn is also at the epitome of research in Molecular Biology. And therefore would be a perfect platform for me to start my research journey.My journey at D. Y. Patil Biotechnology and Bioinformatics Institute has been fruitful. I want to thank all my teachers at DYPBBI, with special mentions to Dr Neelu Nawani, Dr Arvind Goja, Dr Amit Ranjan, and Dr Manjusha Dake, for writing me the letters of recommendation. Apart from them, I was fortunate to have teachers like Dr Gunjan Tyagi, Dr Kasim Khan, Dr Sarika Pawar, Dr Soumya Basu Sil, PhD, Dr Prakash Nemade and Mr Sampat Jadhav. They always cleared my concepts when required and encouraged me to give my best in everything.I also consider my experience at Rapture Biotech International Pvt Ltd filled with tremendous hands-on learning and excellent work culture. It gave me space to explore Molecular biology along with a fun-filled learning process. I want to thank my guide, Ms Priyanka P. (Director, Rapture Biotech Ahmedabad), for always keeping her doors open to my queries and bringing out the best in me.I was lucky to have seniors like Jishwa Shah, Hemangi Gehlot, and Krupali Tukadiya Tuakadiya. They helped me throughout my work at Rapture Biotech International and my GRE preparations.Seniors from my undergrad and the batch I consider to have many of my heroes had fantastic people like Siddharth Doshi, Dixita Zod, Mayuri Dhapre, Jainish Kothari, Nitesh pradhan, and Aashish Borude, who guided me in my way through a lot of bad phases.I want to mention a special person without whose support I probably would not have made my way to #upenn. My college friend, Shruti Khanpara, stood by my side throughout my entire GRE journey. Her guidance and involvement motivated me to push a little further and ultimately resulted in me getting a good GRE score.And apart from that, she was always there throughout the thick and thin of giving IELTS and university selection. Also, I give my utmost gratitude to Dhanvi Patel, who never gave up on me when it came to any help that I required, say academic, with my IELTS,to psychological assistance; they were right there as firm and grounded as a tree.Finally, the support system of my life, my parents, and my entire family always encouraged me to stay curious and think out of the box.#universityofpennsylvania","41":"The Strokes, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, LCD Soundsystem, Interpol, and The Rapture were genuinely game changing.

Born in what is now west-central Poland, Helena Kowalska was the third of 10 children. She worked as a housekeeper in three cities before joining the Congregation of the Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy in 1925. She worked as a cook, gardener, and porter in three of their houses. In addition to carrying out her work faithfully, and generously serving the needs of the sisters and the local people, Sister Faustina also had a deep interior life. This included receiving revelations from the Lord Jesus, messages that she recorded in her diary at the request of Christ, and her confessors. At a time when some Catholics had an image of God as such a strict judge that they might be tempted to despair about the possibility of being forgiven, Jesus chose to emphasize his mercy and forgiveness for sins acknowledged and confessed. \u201cI do not want to punish aching mankind,\u201d he once told Saint Faustina, \u201cbut I desire to heal it, pressing it to my merciful heart.\u201d The two rays emanating from Christ\u2019s heart, she said, represent the blood and water poured out after Jesus\u2019 death. Because Sister Maria Faustina knew that the revelations she had already received did not constitute holiness itself, she wrote in her diary: \u201cNeither graces, nor revelations, nor raptures, nor gifts granted to a soul make it perfect, but rather the intimate union of the soul with God. These gifts are merely ornaments of the soul but constitute neither its essence nor its perfection. My sanctity and perfection consist in the close union of my will with the will of God.\u201d by Franciscan Media.All Sacred\/Fine Art: All pictures:  #dinocarbetta.com #Italy #sacredart #RightToLife #religiousart #italia #italianlandscapes #catholicart #fineart #jesuschrist #virginmary #sacredheart #holyspirit #immaculata #immaculateheartofmary #catholicchurch #avemaria #blessedvirginmary #stfaustina #divinemercy #diaryofsaintfaustina #straphael #divinemercycenter #shrineofjesusthedivinemercy #stjohnpaulii","45":"Forty-one years ago, Blondie hit the top of Billboard's Hot 100 with 'Rapture,' the first #1 song to feature rap, giving a shout-out to hip-hop pioneers Fab Five Freddy and Grandmaster Flash. #MusicIsLife","46":"Remember the old Mastercard \"priceless\" ad campaign?

Where does a soul reside? Is a soul eternal?The soul has been the center of great philosophical and religious discussions since time immemorial.The Torah is sprinkled with three words that help define the soul: nefesh, ruach and neshama.Their individual meanings have evolved throughout the Tanach as we have wrestled with defining the innate source of spirituality.In this visual expression, the Kabbalistic interpretation was chosen, focusing on the first three ascending levels of the soul.Each word stands on its own in design and concept but is also an integral part of the triptych.Nefesh:At this basic, animalistic level, body and soul are one.Man was created from the dust of the earth and G-d breathed soul into him.The nefesh painting shows the paths from the earth below and from the breath of G-d above.Ruach: This level of the soul connects nefesh to higher realms. Meaning spirit and wind, ruach's energy enables the nefesh to ascend.The ruach painting embodies the major movement in the triptych, connecting the paintings on either side.The dot of the vav is the center of the total design, reminding us that G-d is the center of all things.Neshama: This is the highest level our souls can attain within the framework of our understanding.At this level, a soul strives to connect with G-d using intelligence, awe and \"rapture of the heart.\"The golden circle in the neshama painting symbolizes G-dliness. The brilliant red expresses that this level is closest to G-d.A spiral runs through all three paintings. Much like a staircase, it travels both ways.G-d's breath descends to implant the soul in the body.The soul ascends to G-d through actions, emotions, and thought.marleneburns2021 #art #artist #marleneburns #spirituality #religion #judaism #Hebrew #soul #artprints","48":"\u201cTHE APOSTLE PAUL\u2019S ENDTIME REVELATION OF TWO IMPORTANT EVENTS!\u201d\u201cBUT WE DO NOT WANT YOU TO BE UNINFORMED, BRETHREN, ABOUT THOSE WHO ARE ASLEEP (*DIED IN CHRIST), SO THAT YOU WILL NOT GREIVE AS DO THE REST WHO HAVE NO HOPE.FOR IF WE BELIEVE THAT JESUS DIED AND ROSE AGAIN, EVEN SO GOD WILL BRING WITH HIM THOSE WHO HAVE FALLEN ASLEEP IN JESUS (*TRUE BELIEVERS FALL ASLEEP BUT NEVER DIE BECAUSE THEY HAVE ETERNAL LIFE!).FOR THIS WE SAY TO YOU BY THE WORD OF THE LORD, THAT WE WHO ARE ALIVE AND REMAIN UNTIL THE COMING OF THE LORD (*FOR HIS CHURCH), WILL NOT PRECEDE THOSE WHO HAVE FALLEN ASLEEP.

Toward the end of the 1st centuryBCE, the Celtiberian town of Salduba at the site was taken by the Romans, who made it a colony under EmperorAugustuswith the name of Caesaraugusta. The chief commercial and military station in the Ebro valley, it was one of the first towns in Spain to be Christianized, and it had a bishop by the mid-3rd centuryCE. After falling to the Germanic Suebi and then to the Visigoths in the 5th century, the town was taken by the Moors about 714. In 778 it was besieged by the Frankish king Charlemagne, who had to withdraw because of a Saxon rebellion in his domain. After being captured by the Almoravids in 1110, Zaragoza was taken by King Alfonso I of Aragon in 1118 and thereafter enjoyed three and a half centuries of prosperity as capital of Aragon. In thePeninsular Warit was famed for the resistance of its citizens under Gen. Jos\u00e9 de Palafox y Melzi during a siege (from 1808\u201309) by the French, who took the city. Among the defenders was Mar\u00eda August\u00edn, the \u201cMaid of Saragossa,\u201d whose exploits are described inLord Byron\u2019spoem \u201cChilde Harold.\u201d+ The image of the multi-domed Bas\u00edlica del Pilar reflected in the R\u00edo Ebro is a potent symbol of Zaragoza. Yet, there is plenty more fine architecture here too, including a turreted castle with an interior like a mini-Alhambra, and some underground Roman remains. Still, Zaragoza's appeal goes well beyond its monuments. Spain\u2019s fifth-largest city has one of the best tapas and bar scenes in the country and is well stocked with the epoch-defining art of local lad Francisco de Goya, the genius painter who was born a short horse-ride away in 1746. The historic center (between the R\u00edo Ebro, Calle del Coso, and Avenida C\u00e9sar Augusto) is refreshingly near-traffic-free, including the 400 meter-long Plaza del Pilar alongside the famous basilica.+ A rich blend of the historic and modern, visitors like to stroll in the center of town near San Miguel's pedestrian ways or around the Plaza de los Sitios, where they find boutiques, markets, and souvenir shops. A center for gastronomy, Zaragoza offers food and drink for every budget and taste.+ The seat of an archbishop, Zaragoza has two cathedrals. The older is the Cathedral of La Seo, or Cathedral of Salvador, mainly a Gothic building that shows some traces of the earlier Romanesque church built on the site of the first mosque erected in Spain. TheNuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar Cathedral is dedicated to the Virgin of the Pillar, who is the patron of Spain. Outstandingsecularbuildings include La Lonja (The Exchange), the Palace of the Counts of Luna (in which the Court of Justice sits), and the 17th-century Palace of the Condes de S\u00e1stago y Argillo.","56":"Marlene's Marathon Day.  \"Raptor Rapture\" part of my Raptor Gallery.

Or why do you treat them with contempt? For we will all stand before God\u2019s Judgment Seat. 11It is written: \u201c\u2018As surely as I live,\u2019 says the Lord,\u2018every knee will bow before me; every tongue will acknowledge God.\u2019\u201d 12So then, each of us will give an account of ourselves to God.What happens after the rapture? The rapture will certainly happen someday. Each day we are moving towards this great day of the rapture and one day the saints, those who have been washed clean in The Blood of Jesus will be caught up in Heaven with Jesus. The apostle Paul wrote that when the rapture happens those who died in Christ will rise first and those alive will follow them and meet them in the sky.1st Thessalonians 4:16-17For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.17After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever.We should expect after the rapture, Judgment will happen for all of mankind at one point but people tend to not live their life in a manner that reflects that one day they will be judged by the Lord God Almighty. I am sure that one day I will be judged for my actions. The truth brothers and sisters, we will all one day be judged by Christ. No one will escape judgment but there is one thing we need to know: what Christians would be facing is The Judgment Seat of Christ that is different from the Judgment Seat of the unbelievers will face at the end of everything called the final judgment. The unbelievers and those who rejected Christ will be facing the Great White Throne and God and He will be the Judge there at the end of this age.Judgment is the lake of fire reserved for many for the sons and daughters of disobedience.The Judgment of the Dead >Revelation 20:11-12 Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. The earth and the heavens fled from his presence, and there was no place for them. 12And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened.

As a young sales executive with a demanding job, she didn\u2019t have the option of not reporting to work, and would often sneak me in through a back entrance and we would quietly (but swiftly) run through the halls. I remember the distinct scent of Big Red gum mixed with Victoria\u2019s Secret Rapture as she carried my small-but-heavy body up many flights of stairs in an effort to avoid coworkers before making it safely to her office door. One day, her boss found me. Not long after, she was hunting for another job. I remember her saying, \u201cOne day, when you grow up, I hope that you will have a boss who supports working moms.\u201dAs my 6-year old daughter sits at my messy desk in my basement office while I vet contract opportunities and freelance gigs, I realize just how lucky I am to have the flexibility that my mother never did\u2014 and the willingness to fight for it.

No matter how highly placed or comfortable we are on earth. This entire world and all the glories we see in it cannot compare to the experience of Heaven's Glory and Beauty. We need to be careful not to pursue the momentary pleasures of this world. It's not easy especially when you have satan and his minions constantly shoulder surfing us and whispering temptations into our ears 24\/7. One day God will take away that power from them and they will be locked up in the abyss for eternity and all of his henchmen. I can't wait for that Glorious day.2nd Corinthians 4:17-18 For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all.18So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.It's going to be a great reunion in the skies which is referred to in The Bible as The First Heaven. The 2nd Heaven is Space and The 3rd Heaven is where God and His Angels Reside. Rapture is an event that is yet to happen. It is going to be the most sudden event that has ever been experienced on earth. It will happen in split seconds. How do we know that? The Bible tells us that it will happen in the twinkling of an eye.How Long Does It Take To Blink? On average the human blink lasts only a tenth of a second which is 100 milliseconds. Wow, that\u2019s fast! Sometimes, it can even last up to 400 milliseconds.

It's called The Blessed Hope.Titus 2:13 while we wait for the blessed hope of the glory of our Great God and Savior Jesus Christ.We are going to be caught up in the air away from all of the suffering that this world brings soon enough.In three Gospels, Matthew, Mark and Luke, when Jesus was instructing those closest to Him about the future, we discover this; \u201cAnd then shall they see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.\u201d When we couple this With 1st Thessalonians 4:17; \u201cThen we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air:\u201d how can we not have faith for the \u201cRapture?\u201d A natural question for those who believe in the Rapture is God's Elect.Matthew 24:31 And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.Mark 13:27 And he will send his angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of the heavens.\u201cAnd He shall send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together His ELECT from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.\u201d and \u201cthen shall He send angels and gather together His ELECT from the four winds from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.\u201d Here we see that those being gathered are God\u2019s own ELECT. We find the Greek for elect, from Strong\u2019s concordance says; \u201cselect, by implication, favorite: chosen, elect, to select, make choice, choose (out), chosen\u201d.The ELECT who shall be gathered in that moment. The Bible declares in Luke 17: \u201cpray always that you be accounted worthy to escape all these things (end-times judgments) that shall come to pass, and stand before the Son of man\u201d.Take notice that the ELECT are gathered from the uttermost parts of heaven and earth. Two places, heaven and earth. This also takes us back to 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 \u201cthe dead in Christ\u201d (whose spirits wait in heaven) and \u201cwe which are alive and remain (on the earth) shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.\u201d The ELECT shall be gathered from both heaven and earth.","70":"The Second Coming of Jesus | What Happens When He Returns!

There are many things about our lives now that we can only speculate about. Not just our lives as an abstract concept. I am talking about our lives in the tangible material sense. The human body is intricately woven together by God. God gave thought to the creation of man in the old testament and continues to do so even now. We can tell from scripture that the bodies we have now are very different from the bodies of men we read about in scripture. They look the same but function differently. I find it difficult to imagine life in a period when men lived with frequency past 100 years. We are told in The Bible that there was such a time. Enoch was one of the youngest of those old men.Genesis 5:21-24 When Enoch had lived 65 years, he became the father of Methuselah. 22After he became the father of Methuselah, Enoch walked faithfully with God for 300 years and had other sons and daughters. 23Altogether, Enoch lived a total of 365 years. 24Enoch walked faithfully with God; then he was no more, because God took him away.Enoch was a youngin compared to his son, Methuselah. Methuselah was the Grandpa of Noah. Methuselah in The Bible is the man who lived the longest in history. He lived to be 969 years old. Genesis 5:27 Altogether, Methuselah lived a total of 969 years, and then he died.Genesis 5:25 When Methuselah had lived 187 years, he became the father of Lamech.Genesis 5:28-29 When Lamech had lived 182 years, he had a son. 29He named him Noah and said, \u201cHe will comfort us in the labor and painful toil of our hands caused by the ground the Lord has cursed.\u201dHow did we move from that to where we are now where the average life expectancy is estimated to be in the mid seventies. God made it that way. That is why. Psalm 90:10Psalm 90:10 Our days may come to seventy years, or eighty, if our strength endures; yet the best of them are but trouble and sorrow, for they quickly pass, and we fly away.When we look to the future when the age of the church has ended.How do we know if the age will come to an end. The Bible tells us so. When the age is ended, God's Grace is ended and that is why you should seek His Grace now.","73":"The Last Sign Before The Rapture >This world will be wrapped up and there will be a New Heaven and a New Earth where there will be no sorrow, no sickness or death.Revelation 21:4 He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death\u2019 or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.\u201dThis current world must pass away or The New World will not come. Something must happen before this takes place. We must hear the sound of the trumpet.1st Corinthians 15:51-53 Behold! I tell you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, 52in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we shall be changed. 53For this perishable body must put on the imperishable, and this mortal body must put on immortality. The Angel of The Lord will blow the trumpet as Jesus appears in the sky and we who believe in Him dead or alive will defy the law of gravity and be caught up with Him in the sky. This is not the 2nd coming. Jesus will not land on the earth when the rapture takes place. We go to meet him in the sky.It's the catching up of the saints to be with The Lord is what we call the rapture.1st Thessalonians 4:16-18 For the Lord himself will come down from heaven,with a loud command, with the voice of the archangeland with the trumpet call of God,and the dead in Christ will rise first.17After that, we who are still alive and are leftwill be caught up together with them in the cloudsto meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lordforever.18Therefore encourage one anotherwith these words.The sound of the trumpet is symbolic in The Old Testament. It was used to call for people to gather. When I was a kid, I had a friend who lived on a farm across the street from me and they used a bell that you used your hand to ring which indicated it is time for supper.Leviticus 23:24\u201cSay to the Israelites: \u2018On the first day of the seventh month you are to have a day of sabbath rest, a sacred assembly commemorated with trumpet blasts.The Prophet and warrior Joshua after marching around the city of Jericho blasting the shofar which is a rams horn cracked the city walls around Jericho and took the city for The Lord.Joshua 6:1-5 Now the gates of Jericho were securely barred because of the Israelites. No one went out and no one came in.2Then the Lord said to Joshua, \u201cSee, I have delivered Jericho into your hands, along with its king and its fighting men. 3March around the city once with all the armed men. Do this for six days. 4Have seven priests carry trumpets of rams\u2019 horns in front of the ark. On the seventh day, march around the city seven times, with the priests blowing the trumpets. 5When you hear them sound a long blast on the trumpets, have the whole army give a loud shout; then the wall of the city will collapse and the army will go up, everyone straight in.\u201d","74":"This Biblical End Time Prophecy May Happen This Year IN 2022 >The event of the Rapture of The Saints will be one of the Greatest Events in The History of Earth. There will be Great Joy for The Believers who are caught up to See Christ. Their Sorrows will be forever in The Past never to be experienced or remembered again. Blessed are those who will take part in this event. Rapture is an event in which The Saints in Christ will have their bodies transformed and transfigured and caught up into the skies. It is comforting to know that we will someday meet with The Lord and Forever be with Him. At the Rapture, we will meet The Lord in The Air. Jesus will not step foot on earth at the rapture. How do we know this? Jesus tells us in The Bible here:1st Thessalonians 4:17 After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever.He does set foot on the earth at The Mount of Olives on His 2nd Coming. The Bible tells us here:Zechariah 14:4 On that day his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, east of Jerusalem, and the Mount of Olives will be split in two from east to west, forming a great valley, with half of the mountain moving north and half moving south.The Bible has given us enough proof to show that a rapture is an event that will undoubtedly come to pass. The Bible gives us accounts of two men who never tasted death but were transfigured. It is Written in Genesis 5:24 Enoch walked faithfully with God; then he was no more, because God took him away. Elijah was also caught up from the Earth by a Chariot of Fire. 2nd Kings 2:11 s they were walking along and talking together, suddenly a chariot of fireand horses of fire appeared and separated the two of them, and Elijah went up to heavenin a whirlwind. If God did it before he can do it again.1st Corinthians 15:51-58Behold! I tell you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, 52in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we shall be changed. 53For this perishable body must put on the imperishable, and this mortal body must put on immortality. 54When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: \u201cDeath is swallowed up in victory.\u201d 55\u201cO death, where is your victory?O death, where is your sting?\u201d 56The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. 57But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. 58Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain.","75":"THERE ARE TWO JUDGMENT SEATS TO BE IN > THE CHOICE IS YOURS AND YOURS ALONE > WHICH ONE WILL YOU BE IN >One thing no human can run from is Judgment Day. There is no way anyone can call in sick that day or be on vacation. There is no way that anyone will not be present.  Roll Call will be taken.The first Judgment, you definitely want to be there as one of God's Saints. The second Judgment, you do not want to be there.THIS IS THE JUDGMENT SEAT OF CHRIST THAT YOU WANT TO BE AT:2nd Corinthians 5:10-11 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each of us may receive what is due us for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad.Romans 14:10-12 You, then, why do you judge your brother or sister? Or why do you treat them with contempt? For we will all stand before God\u2019s judgment seat. 11It is written: \u201c\u2018As surely as I live,\u2019 says the Lord, \u2018every knee will bow before me; every tongue will acknowledge God.\u2019\u201d 12So then, each of us will give an account of ourselves to God.1st Thessalonians 4:16-17For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.17After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever.This first Judgment is for the believers in Jesus Christ to reward them for being faithful to God and this happens after the rapture and during the tribulation and before the Wedding Supper of The Lamb and before the thousand year reign of Christ here on earth with the saints. There is no condemnation. Romans 8:1 Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.Faithful believers will receive rewards for their service to The Lamb. Any good works done In The Name of Jesus Christ will be rewarded as a prelude to eternity spent in The Presence of God. Each person's motives, desires, and reasons for serving God will be judged. Works rooted in pure motives will be rewarded, all others will be burned according to scripture.1st Corinthians 3:11-15 For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ.12If anyone builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay or straw,13their work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each person\u2019s work.14If what has been built survives, the builder will receive a reward.15If it is burned up, the builder will suffer loss but yet will be saved\u2014even though only as one escaping through the flames.","76":"BE READY FOR WHAT IS COMING > The Rapture is Coming > Be Ready >The Day and Hour UnknownMatthew 24:36-44 \u201cBut about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son,[f] but only the Father. 37As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. 38For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; 39and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. 40Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left. 41Two women will be grinding with a hand mill; one will be taken and the other left.42\u201cTherefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come. 43But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into. 44So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.Our Lord is coming, are you Ready? Revelation 22:7 \u201cLook, I am coming soon! Blessed is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy written in this scroll.\u201dThe 2nd Coming is on the way but the Rapture of God's Elect must happen first and that kicks off the 7 Year Tribulation Daniel Refers in the Book of Daniel. Are you Fearful of this Day or are you Joyful for this day? How you answer this question will give you a gauge of where you are in your relationship with God right now. Two Good Principles to live by are this. Plan your Life as if Jesus is not coming for 100 Years but Live your Life as if he is coming back today. If the Rapture happens during our lifetime which I think it is going to happen sooner than later and if you do not get snatched up with God's Elect. There is Good News. You will have a 2nd chance during this 7 year period but it will not be easy. Just do not take the Mark of the Beast and if you repent and turn to God, you will Go to Heaven.Revelation 14:9-10 A third angel followed them and said in a loud voice: \"If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives its mark on their forehead or on their hand, they, too, will drink the wine of God's fury, which has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath. They will be tormented with burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb.The Spirit Testifies, we are in the Last Hour and there is not a lot of time. These are very sobering times for the Body of Christ and we must pray on a Daily Basis and be in touch with The Holy Spirit that God has given us. We must see how much we are in Need of God and His Grace. There are a lot of people in this world that have pride and I know I have struggled with Pride in my Life.","77":"\"When the Rapture of the Church (Believers In Christ) has taken place, many will suddenly realize that God has really fulfilled His promise\" ","78":"I woke up this morning to a full inbox, I was like what's happening here?

For several months, the impassioned and delusional rhetoric coming from the supporters of Trump\/GOP\/MAGA has become increasingly dark, often imploring their followers to prepare for civil war and acts of violence against Democrats or anyone who doesn't support their idea of \"patriotism.\" Since November 2020 they have continually, non-stop, pushed the idea of a stolen election and an illegitimate President Biden, claiming, without any proof, that Donald Trump is still the President of the United States. After the January 6, 2021 insurrection, state election workers and officials, especially in the 6-7 \"swing states\" that determined the electoral college votes, have repeatedly been harrassed and threatened with violence for simply doing their jobs of ensuring the electoral process was done fairly and accurately. Those threats, including threats to their families, have not only not stopped, they have gotten worse, as have threats to other state and federal elected officials and their families, primarily Democrat officials. No democracy can survive this level of violence and threatened violence to its election workers. That simply erodes the bedrock of any democratic nation: its system of free and fair elections. Russia knows this. China knows this. North Korea and Iran know this. They are all watching with unabashed glee as the far-right, GOP\/MAGA crowd, a group that is obviously suffering from a deranged virus,  works to destroy our democratic republic and hand it over to people that the autocratic nations I just listed would be proud of.#supportukraine#armukrainenow#cancelrussia#glorytoukraine#putin#warcrimes #gop #republicanparty #trump #maga #maralago","141":"Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), a member of the Jan. 6 committee, acknowledged in aninterviewwith ABC News\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday that \u201cthe Justice Department appears to be pursuing this pretty hard.\u201d It has plainly indicated that its investigation has moved beyond the events that took place on Jan. 6, confiscating phones of key players such as former Justice Department officialJeffrey Clarkand Trump lawyerJohn Eastmanandsummoninghigh-level witnesses such as Marc Short and Greg Jacob before a grand jury.Garland himself hasstatedthat if there are sufficient facts to prove a case of conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding or defraud the United States against someone, his department would be compelled to bring charges against them regardless of who they are. Likewise, if there are sufficient facts to hold Trump responsible for violence on Jan. 6, a seditious conspiracy charge is hardly out of the question.In other words, the Justice Department is not the player that should worry democracy defenders. More important is whether voters will do their part to keep election deniers out of office in November.Asked about such candidates on the ballot, Kinzinger observed, \u201cI don\u2019t think this is just going to go away organically. This is going to take the American people really standing up and making the decision that truth matters.\u201d He added that the challenge with these Republicans is that they \u201ccan\u2019t even agree on basic facts or will lie to the American people.\u201dThis is despite the efforts of the Jan. 6 committee, which has exceeded all expectations in debunking the \u201cbig lie\u201d of a stolen election and detailing Trump\u2019s deliberate attempt to retain power by whatever means necessary. Voters might still decide to hand the House to Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and his band of election deniers. There is no backstop for democracy, as we saw on Jan. 6, without responsible people in key positions. Had Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger not denied Trump\u2019s demand for him to \u201cfind\u201d enough votes to swing his state, or had Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers not refused to reconvene the legislature to revoke the electors whom voters selected, we might have fallen into a constitutional crisis.Next time, if McCarthy insists on entertaining spurious objections to electoral votes, or if Lake and other MAGA governors refuse to certify the actual winner in their states, the ensuing chaos could make Jan. 6 look like a picnic. This could deal a fatal blow to our democracy.But once democracy is lost, it is irretrievable. The most important question is no longer whether Garland will fail democracy, but whether the American people will.","142":"A group of prominent conservatives released a new report Thursday outlining their investigation into the 2020 election and have concluded former President Trump's claims of a stolen election are unfounded. The report was put together by three former federal judges and eight conservative leaders who investigated Trump's claims. Over the course of a year, the group looked at all 64 cases of the Trump campaign's fraudulent claims in six key states and concluded that there were no substantial instances of fraud that would have changed the election results. The report goes state by state and claim by claim, taking time to investigate each legal case. Note this was reported by the Fox Network .How do hardline Trump supporters react to being victim of the \"big lie\" for 20 months? Trumps position on the election resulted in what galvanized the positions of blue vs red and was the basis of the Jan 6 coup attempt and insurrection. 9 lives were lost from Jan 6 for a cause that now has no basis in fact as confirmed by the report issued by Conservatives.

The plans are part of a new wave of initiatives that Republicans say are directed at voter fraud. They are being condemned by voting rights advocates and even some local election supervisors, who call them costly and unnecessary appeasement of the Republican base that will select primary-election winners for this November\u2019s midterms and the 2024 presidential race.The next round of voting clashes comes after the apparent demise of Democratic voting rights legislation in Washington on Thursday. It is a reminder that while the Democratic agenda in Washington seems dead, Republican state-level efforts to make voting harder show no sign of slowing down. Supporters say the added enforcement will root out instances of fraud and assure the public that everything possible is being done to make sure that American elections are accurate and legitimate. Critics say the efforts can easily be abused and used as political cudgels or efforts to intimidate people from registering and voting. And Democrats say the main reason Republican voters have lost faith in the electoral system is because of the incessant Republican focus on almost entirely imagined fraud.\"The most concrete proposal is in Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis asked the State Legislature last week for $5.7 million to create a 52-person \u201celection crimes and security\u201d force in the secretary of state\u2019s office. That was followed on Thursday by a pledge by David Perdue, the former Georgia senator who is a Republican candidate for governor, to create his own force of election police \u201cto make Georgia elections the safest and securest in the country.\u201d And in Arizona, a vocal supporter of former President Donald J. Trump\u2019s lies about a stolen election, State Senator Wendy Rogers, has filed legislation to establish a $5 million \u201cbureau of elections\u201d in the governor\u2019s office with the power to subpoena witnesses and impound election equipment.\" - NY Times (behind paywall)#intelligencecommunity #securityprofessionals #securityindustry #electionintegrity #election2020 #election2022 #election2024 #republicanparty #gop #florida #georgia #arizona #elections #police #lawenforcement #domesticterrorism #nationalsecurity #democracy #insurrection #treason #votingrights #racisminamerica","147":"Deep Enough For Hip Bootsby Jennifer RubinWednesday was bad enough for Donald Trump. Then he dug himself deeper.The day started off with the announcement that New York Attorney General Letitia James filed a devastating civil lawsuit against him and his company for what it alleges was massive fraud over years. Then, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit granted the government\u2019s request for a stay of U.S. District Judge Aileen M. Cannon\u2019s outlandish ruling that had effectively paused the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into the mishandling of classified documents.That\u2019s when Trump made things worse for himself. In a pre-recorded interview with Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity, he insisted: \u201cIf you\u2019re the president of the United States, you can declassify just by saying, it\u2019s declassified. Even by thinking about it, because you\u2019re sending it to Mar-a-Lago or to wherever you\u2019re sending it.\u201d This, of course, acknowledges that the documents he hoarded were highly sensitive, that Trump knew they were and that he sent them to Mar-a-Lago anyway.Former FBI special agent Asha Rangappa called Trump\u2019s remarks the \u201cSecret Telepathic Unilateral Preemptive Irreversible Declassification\u201d \u2014 or \u201cS.T.U.P.I.D.\u201d \u2014 defense. Others simply called it \u201cinsane.\u201d All true, but most of all it is \u201ctypical\u201d and \u201cpar for the course.\u201dThis is precisely the sort of self-damaging delusion that we have come to expect from Trump. After all, he has been saying outlandish, blatantly false things for years \u2014 from his lies that President Barack Obama was not born in this country to his claims that the call in which he extorted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was \u201cperfect.\u201dUnfortunately, the mainstream media has refused to come right out and say it: He\u2019s unable to process reality.

Clements\u2019s strategy is to target his message locally: to county commissioners and clerks, jobs that wield an outsize role in administering America\u2019s decentralized election system. If local jurisdictions fail to certify their votes, it could throw the outcome of an election into chaos, raising doubt about the results and giving ammunition to losing candidates who refuse to accept their defeat.Clements is one among a tightknit circle of Trump supporters who travel the country as self-appointed election fraud evangelists.

A JAMA study estimated that ivermectin scripts cost private & #Medicare #insurance plans over $2.49 million in one week.","252":"The story about how ivermectin, a decades-old antiparasitic, became controversial is complicated. It's not just about Joe Rogan or Aaron Rodgers talking about taking the drug when they tested positive for the virus, it's about our flawed scientific process and the challenges of watching science and regulatory decisions play out in real-time over the course of the pandemic.","253":"Ivermectin\u2019s largest clinical trial to date vs COVID Showed it failed to reduce all severe outcomes. In other words? Ivermectin not effective vs COVID. \u201cThe largest clinical trial to date on the use of the antiparasitic drug ivermectin against COVID-19 concluded that the drug is completely ineffective at treating the pandemic disease, according to results published in the NEJM Group's New England Journal of Medicine.The double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was primarily designed to test if ivermectin could reduce the need for hospitalization among 1,358 COVID-19 patients at high risk of severe disease. Ivermectin did not, according to the international team of researchers behind the trial, dubbed TOGETHER.\"We did not find a significantly or clinically meaningful lower risk of medical admission to a hospital or prolonged emergency department observation with ivermectin,\" the researchers reported.The folks with TOGETHER also found that the drug failed to reduce all other secondary outcomes of COVID-19, including the time to recovery, time to viral clearance on PCR test, time spent in the hospital, the need for mechanical ventilation, the duration of mechanical ventilation, death, or the time to death. \"We found no important effects of treatment with ivermectin on the secondary outcomes,\" the researchers wrote.\u201dThanks to Beth Mole, writing for Ars Technica - link to that article in the comments (and in that article, there is a link to the original NEJM paper).#clinicaltrials #ivermectin #covid19","254":"I have Covid now.

Instead of a safe treatment, we were mandated to take unproven experimental treatments, which have since proven ineffective if not dangerous.  Don\u2019t ever tell anyone to be quiet and follow the science again.","258":"\"Unfortunately, a large part of the ivermectin \u201cdebate\u201d has been severely polluted by fraudulent and poorly done studies. Many of the papers that suggested a possible benefit have been retracted or found to be fundamentally flawed. But the damage has been done. These studies live on as unkillable Zombie Papers that feed the \u201civermectin works!\u201d mythology.And why do they live on? Because ivermectin very quickly became not about science but about ideology and in-group signaling. It was pushed by a variety of right-wing voices, Covid contrarians, QAnon backers and, even, state actors, such as China and Russia, to promote information chaos in support of many agendas, both personal (e.g., profiting from the sale of ivermectin) and ideological (e.g., fostering distrust in national political and public health institutions).\"","259":"Great investigational reporting by NPR Geoff Brumfiel on a case of someone foregoing #covid #vaccination for other treatment, such as Ivermectin.

Disgusting.","261":"Ivermectin Still Ineffective Against OmicronNo, a Japanese company did not find that ivermectin was \u201ceffective\u201d against the omicron variant in a clinical trial, as Reuters originally reported on Monday. The wire service was forced to correct the article.The actual news, as the current version of the article reads, is that ivermectin carries an \u201c\u2018antiviral effect\u2019 against Omicron and other coronavirus variants in joint nonclinical research.\u201dThe difference between the two versions couldn\u2019t be more dramatic: The mistaken version claimed that ivermectin was effective against omicron in humans; the corrected version claimed that ivermectin showed \u201cantiviral\u201d capabilities against omicron in test tubes. The antiviral capabilities of ivermectin against SARS-CoV-2 in a test-tube environment are not a matter of breaking news: Research dating to 2020 showed that \u201ca single dose of ivermectin was able to reduce the replication of an Australian isolate of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero\/hSLAM cells by 5000-fold.\u201d There were many reasons, however, for skepticism about how that finding would carry over into real-life treatment.But ivermectin has remained in the spotlight thanks to boosters such as Joe Rogan, Spotify\u2019s star podcaster who is currently dealing with a backlash over his covid commentary. Rogan told his audience in September that ivermectin was among the drugs he\u2019d taken after testing positive for the coronavirus. Ivermectin is an anti-parasitic drug that comes in both animal and human formulations, and the Food and Drug Administration has counseled against its use against covid.Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, says that if the original test-tube studies on ivermectin are believed to predict clinical benefit, it\u2019s not surprising that the drug would have test-tube \u201cactivity\u201d against omicron. That said, it\u2019s of \u201csome interest whether ivermectin has test tube activity against omicron,\u201d he writes via email.It\u2019s certainly of interest to ivermectin boosters:Reuters says it hustled to set the record straight: \u201cThe original Reuters story misstated that ivermectin was \u2018effective\u2019 against Omicron in Phase III clinical trials, which are conducted in humans. We corrected this to clarify it had an \u2018antiviral effect\u2019 against Omicron and it was shown in joint nonclinical research. After being made aware of the error, we corrected our story immediately.\u201dWe don\u2019t doubt Reuters\u2019s diligence in correcting itself; we doubt only how effective it\u2019ll be. The report, after all, landed in a country where poison control centers last year were beset by an increase in ivermectin overdose calls \u2014 the byproduct of one strain of covid hype\/misinformation.Look for that machine to roar once more, perhaps by claiming that Reuters had it right the first time. Early Tuesday morning, host Mike Dinow of One America News (OAN) told viewers: \u201cA top Japanese drugmaker confirms ivermectin is highly efficient in fighting covid-19 and the omicron strain.","262":"An education is more than just job skills.

Me and my wife decided not to get vaccinated because some of the sideffects, religious reasons, and since vaccinated people can still get and give covid to others anyway. We are trail blazers. So we had prepared ahead of time with preventative medications and vitamins. We had symptoms and tested positive for covid.  At home we took Ivermectin (not horse paste), HCQ (Hydroxychloroquine), Vit C, Vit D, Zinc, and Aspirin. 24-48 hours later our symptoms were gone. We believe we now have some natural immunity. However, we are going utilize antibody testing to benchmark our immunity every other month to see how long it lasts and report out later. This has had been a wild and eventful journey. Stay safe y\u2019all!!","264":"This goes way beyond the Ivermectin fiasco to our society as a whole and our lack of understanding of what it means to be a scientist and the use of the scientific method. We are all about headlines and supporting our already conceived agendas about what we think is the truth.  We need to return to the days of open-minded exploration and leave behind the polarization of science and society.

Impaled on the spire of Cornell\u2019s 173-foot tall McGraw Tower was a round orange object that appeared to be a large pumpkin. Campus police launched an investigation, but were unable to uncover how or why this had come to be. Especially after The Today Show covered the story, people across the nation wondered how it got there. A cornucopia of theories arose: Was it dropped from an unwitnessed helicopter? Carefully catapulted? The result of paranormal activity?Years later, an anonymous source told the school newspaper that he knew how it was done. A highly motivated student (one might say a student with a \u2018Gourd big or go home\u2019 attitude) and two accomplices gained after hours entry into the tower and discovered an access hatch to the roof. The ringleader climbed the roof under cover of darkness and his accomplices sent up the pumpkin on a rope once he was at the top. He skewered the pumpkin on the spire, climbed down, and the trio went out to laugh about it over beers. The pranksters\u2019 identities remain a mystery.Whoever did it and however it was accomplished, the pumpkin sat there for months. Pictured is its condition on February 20, 1998. When it finally came down in March, plant biology professors conducted cellular analysis and confirmed that it was, indeed, a pumpkin. They also calculated the ratio of the pumpkin\u2019s circumference to its diameter which is, of course, pumpkin pi.

I grew up down the street from where they shot one of the most profitable movies of all time. No this wasn\u2019t a big studio in Los Angeles. This was a quiet suburb in San Diego, and the movie was Paranormal Activity. Made for a budget of only $15,000 and shot in a house that looked frighteningly similar to my own it was no surprise that this movie was inspirational. You see as a young filmmaker in a world where $100 million dollar blockbusters were the norm it made the film industry seem inaccessible. Not to mention that I didn\u2019t have any connections and all my actors came from Craigslist. However, there was one company that changed it all, Blumhouse.I have always had a lot of respect for the work that Blumhouse puts out. They showed me that even with a smaller budget you could make something incredible. With just a house and a video camera, you could create movies that would scare millions of people. And frankly, as a teenager, that is all we had. Films like Get Out, The Purge, Whiplash, Creep, Oculus, Sinister, Hush, Split, The Invisible Man, and many many more were a constant inspiration to me.I am eager to be able to take all the amazing experiences that I have gotten interning at Gunpowder & Sky, and Valhalla Entertainment this past year and apply it at Blumhouse. I am going to be interning on one of the companies newer teams, the features streaming team, which is an incredible opportunity considering my additional interest in the streaming world.Thank you to everyone who helped me along the way to get this internship and I look forward to getting to meet the Blumhouse team next year! Also good luck to everyone in the entertainment industry who is still looking for a spring internship.

Did government subsidize COVID vaccines with tax payer money?  Yes. Did government monopolize medical treatments, called \"vaccines\" by decaring other medical treatments illegal?  Yes.  Hydroxychloroquine and invectermicin were banned and declared unsafe through bogus science or the FDA couldn't grant emergency authorization for untested vaccines.  Exposure to this means I can never trust world health organizations, like the CDC, ever again.  Is the government creating laws that will benefit the Cronies?  Yes.  Vaccine mandates (that could become laws) are forced medical treatments that financially benefit big pharm.  Dr. Fauci financially benefits. There are other mental tests or questions that can be used to tell the difference if one has the ability to THINK CRITICALLY.  Left vs right ideology in terms of cronyism? Less than two decades ago, the left influencer would complain about the rich only existing on the right and the care for people only on the left.  What happened? The rich shifted their place in the paradigm.  The big money is claiming to be on the left. It has hijacked the left and spreads the narrative influence that it is about the people.  So many on the left cannot see that they are standing for political cronyism or they know and agree to it.  Free market capitalism and individual rights to hand in hand.

I made a choice to take a punt on a truly untested vaccine (in comparison to other vaccine trials) in order to reduce my own viral load, and limit the chance of extreme illness or hospitalisation as a result of Covid. I have no regrets.That said I find it somewhat Orwellian that countries, states and businesses would fine staff who don't trust the vaccine. Others still who will reduce sick pay, charge the unvaccinated a premium for medical bills, ban them from indoor spaces. For me I find this insane.There are those who would take the chance in their immune system handling this virus and pursuing other preventative measures such as personal hygiene, social distancing and limited social contact and face mask wearing. Often many take this stance not because of conspiracy theories but just a lack of trust in pharmaceuticals, those in the PPE supply chain and political strong arming.Each to their own, but I am yet to hear a coherent and plausible position why mandates actually move the needle in tackling this pandemic. Or am I missing something?","317":"Well....

I hope that if it does become mandated in Victoria that parents will have the sense to review all information on studies completed in children, along with the evidence on adverse reactions in children... and I hope that children subject to a untested vaccine (over a period of time) sue parents in the future if they have serious side effects...As I have said, the \"shit show\" is just beginning and I am looking forward to seeing the \"experts\" beg for forgiveness in the years ahead, because I don't think they will get much form our younger generations.#health #future #covid #australia #victoria #killthebill","318":"Pfizer BioNTech SE #iwantmymonovelantvaccineback >I can`t imagine this Stupidity of pushing people for an untested vaccine including Steven Goldberg  show with Dr Fauci . >What is done `Gov and Business Elites` had 5 doses of vaccine the rest 3  with the new roll-out .This is a `Vaccine Inequality`. >Link: vaccine ( Ba4 - Ba5 ) is not a viable product that does sell till the trial efficacy datas are reliesed Marvel Link:  Article: ","319":"Currently there are more than113 million iPhone users in the United States, accounting for about 47 percent of all smartphone users in the United States.

When it's the anniversary of the first Moon landing I will invite people on who think it was all fake - for balance you understand.I will co-present weather reports with someone who argues exhaustively against the forecasting method - to provide balance.When I do an item about birds I will invite someone on who believes that the Bird's Aren't Real, but have been replaced by government surveillance drones - yes granted it's crazy, but at least it's providing balance.When I have any subject linked to aviation I'll invite my new Facebook \"chemtrails\" friends (normal people call them contrails) - they think it's planes spraying poisons on us, controlling the weather, and\/or dimming the sun - so as to provide balance.If I'm covering HIV I will invite someone who believes it was created by the Pentagon as a biological weapon, and spread throughout Africa under the guise of a vaccination program - to provide balance.When the next global pandemic happens, or if we get a fresh wave of virulent covid this winter, I'll find people who don't believe in covid, some anti-vaxxers, who object to wearing masks onto the show (they could dramatically fling them to the ground live on telly!) - so as to provide balance.And of course, for anything to do with climate change, I will find people on who say it's not real, who dispute the science, the weather has always changed, who say it's just to control us, and who claim (even though they have not read them, nor are scientifically trained) that that the IPCC reports are wrong - just for balance.- -I know that by doing this I will be buying in to several highly funded, orchestrated disinformation campaigns that are designed to deliberately seed disorientation, to unsettle, weaken and delay.It spreads doubt in nation states and in science, and keeps a bunch of often well-meaning people focused on things that aren't real, rather than a multitude of things that are actually happening.

The researchers discovered that mainstream parenting communities were exposed to misinformation from two different sources within Facebook. First, during 2020, #alternativehealth communities, which generally focus on positive messaging about a healthy immune system, acted as a key conduit between mainstream parenting communities and pre-Covid #conspiracytheory communities that promote misinformation about topics such as climate change, fluoride, chemtrails and 5G. Second, a core of tightly bonded, yet largely under-the-radar, #antivaccination communities, which were found adjacent to the mainstream parenting communities, was able to continually supply COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation to the parenting communities.

With all the stories we hear, and the way we hear them through social media, how can we decern what's true and what isn't? On the one hand, we have access to more information than at any other time in history. On the other hand, that information has nearly always been processed by the time we are exposed to it and it takes time to develop the kind of thinking skills we need to make sense of it. It should be acknowledged that some people do conspire, lie, cover up, and manipulate the facts to serve their own agenda.So where can we start? The great thinker Hume suggested\"No testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle, unless the testimony be of such a kind, that its falsehood would be more miraculous than the fact which it endeavours to establish\"If you want to be very confident in a fantastic story, you have to have fantastic evidence. To be safe, the bigger the story, the bigger the evidence needs to be to support it.We can check \"how easy would it be to argue against this evidence?\"You can also test the opposite.Faced with a fantastic story, we can ask \"are there any simple explanations for this that are much more likely, much more plausible or much more reasonable? Why would I dismiss the simpler explication for this much more elaborate one?'This kind of thinking set the framework for the kind of evidence you might need, how to manage it and the kinds of procedures and tests you might want to consider.- What fantastic stories have you heard?- How do you figure out what's real and what isn't? - What would you want people to rethink? #crticalthinking #thinkingskills #executivecoaching #personaldevelopment #leadershipdevelopment #professionaldevelopment","429":"Interesting article on the differentiation between #Science and #Pseudoscience Not only in view of #Covid-19 pseudoscientists and conspiracy theorists undermine scientifically informed measures.

Most people have seen these white smoke trails \u2014 they\u2019ve become synonymous with aeroplanes. After all, cars and trucks don\u2019t leave behind a white smoke trail, so why do airplanes?The reason planes leave a white smoke trail in their wake is because their exhaust gases contain moisture that condenses at high altitudes. As the plane\u2019s engines release exhaust gases, moisture vapour is released as well. The cold temperature and low air pressure at high altitudes forces this moisture to condense, which creates the characteristic white smoke trail for which panes have become widely known.Therefore, white smoke trails left behind by planes aren\u2019t filled with toxic chemicals. Rather, they are simply the result of moisture vapour in an plane\u2019s exhaust gases. Planes typically won\u2019t leave behind a white smoke trail when taking off or landing. For moisture vapour to condense to the point where it creates a white trail, it must be exposed to high altitudes of at least 20,000 feet.Some might wondering of what about the black smoke planes released? Most planes leave behind a white smoke trail, though some may leave behind a black smoke trail. Black smoke trails aren\u2019t caused by condensation in exhaust gases. Instead, they are caused by an incomplete combustion processes. Just like cars and trucks use combustion to produce power, so do planes. Fuel is fed into the engine\u2019s combustion chamber where it\u2019s ignited to create power. This process, known as combustion, is essential to achieving forward momentum. But some planes may have an incomplete combustion process in which some of the fuel isn\u2019t completely burned.If an engine doesn\u2019t burn all the fuel that\u2019s fed to it, the excess fuel will be released through the plane\u2019s exhaust system, which manifests as a black smoke trail behind the plane. Black smoke trails such as this were more common during the 20th century. Advancements in aerospace engineering now allow for a more complete and efficient combustion process, reducing the risk of black smoke trails.The idea that planes intentionally spray \u201cchemtrails\u201d consisting of harmful chemicals is a myth. As revealed here, planes leave white smoke trails because condensation is present in exhaust gases, which condenses at high altitudes, and they leave black smoke trails when an plane doesn\u2019t have a complete combustion process.","431":"To all my environmentist friends\u2026 perhaps stop looking at your neighbors lifestyle and look up and take in all the chem trails and realize it\u2019s your own government destroying planet earth; not cow farts and fossil fuels.

The ambition to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees is at severe risk. Reducing GHG emissions is proving difficult because the incentives to change behavior and reallocate capital are still largely missing, even though we have been talking about them for the past 30 years.So the conversation has turned more decisively towards the \u201cplan B\u201d of climate change adaptation. This is good news: it might be plan B, but it is also a practical necessity as efforts to reduce GHG emissions fall short of what\u2019s needed, putting more and more lives and livelihoods at risk.But adaptation is likely to be even more difficult to finance than mitigation. This is because it involves investment in infrastructure which would function just fine in the absence of climate change; and because it generates returns which are long-term, unquantifiable and indirect.If both plan A and plan B fall short, what about plan C? The world needs to pay greater attention to geoengineering of the oceans and atmosphere. This does not need to be done immediately. But it does merit greater thought and consideration, particularly as it will take at least a decade to establish the scientific and bureaucratic institutions needed to govern this activity. The world cannot afford to hope for the best by ignoring it.Meanwhile, the US Inflation Reduction Act is a prominent example of massive fiscal and industrial policy for the net zero age. Another is the proposal made by US climate envoy John Kerry to raise and transfer the proceeds of a quasi carbon tax to the Global South.At COP27, there's also welcome sense of urgency about the need to establish carbon credits which are robust, tradeable and insurable, thereby generating reliable sources of revenue which can be channelled back into the financing of mitigation and adaptation efforts.To Sum It Up: There is much more to do to turn isolated examples of progress into systemic change. Greenwashing and \u201cgreen hushing\u201d should be consigned to the past, replaced with a practical set of mandatory ESG disclosure requirements.

The 1.5 degree target is not 'lofty' but also chosen to reduce the likelihood of crossing #tippingpoints. That changes everything. I think it is irresponsible to not even mention climate tipping points in such a high-profile article.Tipping points are thresholds that \u2013 once we pass them \u2013 lead to a self-amplifying acceleration of ecological breakdown which humans cannot stop. For example, melting ice sheets do not reflect as much sunlight anymore and cause the surrounding water to heat up faster \u2013 leading to faster melting of ice sheets and so on.We've known this for a while. But only a few months ago, leading scientists found out that even exceeding 1.5\u00b0C global warming could trigger multiple climate tipping points:  we really tried the fundamental changes that we need to avert or reduce the likelihood of such catastrophic consequences? I don't think so - and therefore couldn't agree less with The Economist. Will it be politically difficult? Yes, absolutely. But this can't stop us from trying harder.(Side note: Even floating the idea of solar geoengineering is dangerous in my opinion. The Economist misses the point that solar geoengineering does not affect the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere which is leading to mind-boggling levels of #oceanacidification.

A Harvard experiment, in conjunction with Sweden, on injecting aerosol particles into the atmosphere was postponed due to activist protests.Deciding not to learn about a technology, of course, is silly and unrealistic, and only surrenders the initiative to less responsible actors. The signers say the risks are unknown but so are the risks of the CO2 experiment already underway. They complain about the lack of a global regulating authority for geoengineering, but no such authority exists for emissions or humanity\u2019s countless impromptu techno-industrial experiments.Ironies abound. The computer models used to forecast future temperatures by necessity must take account of aerosol trends. So refusing to learn about particulate effects already is infeasible.Unfortunately, some scientists, like many journalists, pretend to be inquirers into reality when they are really advertising their affiliation with their chosen virtue movements. The consistent failure of the climate movement has been its towering lack of realism. Developed and developing nations were never going to forgo energy use, but higher and lower carbon paths to the future were still possible.The US and others might have enacted carbon taxes long ago to foster the necessary technologies.

In developed countries, mass casualties from natural disasters are non-existent. Rapid economic development since 1990 is rapidly bringing that capacity to the entire world.* Higher CO2 levels cause a \"greening\" effect that is incredibly beneficial. Increased concentrations of carbon dioxide increase photosynthesis, spurring plant growth. A warmer world is a wetter world due to higher ocean evaporation. More greenery means more animal life and vastly higher agricultural output, enabling a higher standard of living from less farmland.* The negative effects of global warming are vastly overstated by the media. For example, UN's 2021 IPCC climate change report predicts a likely rise of 2.7 degrees by 2100 and 0.44-0.76 meter sea level rise. The actual predictions from mainstream climate science are far less dramatic than demagogues and politicians claim. Markets are already predicting this, which is why beachside property prices keep rising, and low-lying island countries like Vanuatu are rapidly building new airports and beachside resorts.* A warmer world is likely to be a net positive for humanity. Vast swaths of the world (i.e. Siberia) are currently unhospitable because of permafrost. While some already hot places will become less hospitable, they are already sparsely populated. On the other hand, a warmer and wetter world means vast regions like the Sahara, Siberia, Canada, Arctic Circle, etc will become friendly to human and animal life.* Human progress has been accelerating exponentially. Humanity will soon have godlike mastery of our environment. Changing the climate to our liking will be a trivial problem to solve.* Humanity faces far greater existential threats than climate change: We face old and new threats to its survival: nuclear war, rogue AI, grey goo, superviruses, and others. Godlike technological powers can be used for good and evil. We should worry about probable existential threats, not problems we've already learned how to solve.* Even with current technologies, there is a variety of solutions available to mitigate climate change. Iron fertilization of the oceans has been proven cheap and highly effective to sequester CO2. Solar geoengineering (such as stratospheric aerosol injection) can deflect sunlight away from the Earth. The cost of some of these projects is a tiny fraction of the funds already wasted on reducing CO2 emissions.* The use of fossil fuels for energy is a brief temporary transition state in the scope of human progress. There are far more efficient energy sources in development: nuclear fission\/fusion, earth\/space-based solar power, geothermal energy, and others. If technology is allowed to evolve, humanity will adopt more powerful energy sources.","469":"Geoengineering has long been a taboo topic among scientists, but many experts think it's time to explore it.

Take the current war of aggression started by Russia against Ukraine.  Did the people of Russia suddenly woke up on February 24th and decided to slaughter their brothers and sisters in Ukraine? With the exception of very few, Russians in general and especially Russians outside of the country did not.  In the United States and around the world, there is a rise in Asian hate since the start of Covid-19.  While there may be historical origins of this hatred were many, former President Trump's label of \"Chinese virus\" that singling out a group of people to blame surely did not help.  The previous pandemic, the Swine Flu of 2009, originated in the United States.  Should it be called the \"American Flu\"?  Not to mention how unfair it would be to the rest of the Americans outside the United States, just like the Chinese living outside China, the label is misleading and hateful.   What's in a name?  It's really a lot!  Putting the global implications of the war aside and just look the reactions in my area.  People are boycotting Russian restaurants. Sadly, many of these restaurants are actually owned by Ukrainian natives.  And even if they are owned by Russian natives, they are often staffed by Ukrainians.  Plus, I have yet met one Russian who lives in the U.S. that actually endorse the war.  Have you?  In our desire to help the Ukrainians, we may be hurting the very people whom we are trying to help. How ironic is that?The key lesson here, which I I hope we can all reflect upon, is let's be more thoughtful about names. This war of aggression is initiated largely by one person.

Priority was given to those who are most in need, including low-income Asian Americans, the elderly, and women.Numerous members of the AAPI community line up to get a personal safety device at the nonprofit's distribution events.

Trump called into question Scully\u2019s political bias when it was revealed he had worked for Biden decades earlier as an intern while Biden was serving in the U.S. Senate.Trump, ultimately, didn\u2019t agree to the second debate as it was to be held virtually, and Scully was placed on administrative leave by C-SPAN after lying about reaching out to former Trump aide Anthony Scaramucci on Twitter.The commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","519":"what has characterized the entireCCP (Chinese Communist Party) viruspandemic has been a \u201cdegree of fear and people\u2019s response to the fear.\u201d","520":"READ PART 2: \u2018Have Laptop, Will Travel\u2019 - A year before theCCP(Chinese Communist Party) viruspandemic in 2020, Nicozisis published the Wall Street Journal bestseller, \u201cHave Laptop, Will Travel,\u201d a travel narrative based on his year-long journey around the world back in 2017 to 2018.The book recounts his 12-month tour to 12 cities in 10 countries on 4 continents with 48 fellow professionals, while maintaining their businesses via smartphone and laptop.The world has changed much due to the pandemic, he said.Vaccine passports, high fuel costs, regional lockdowns, and war in Eastern Europe have made travel more restrictive when compared to the ease that he experienced four and a half years ago when he went on his world journey.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the world is different,\u201d he said when asked about the changes since his book was published, noting that vaccine passports and other restrictions make travel far more challenging in the pandemic age.\u201cI think that\u2019s what makes my book so relevant at this point in time. It now stands in stark contrast with the idea that I, along with 48 other intrepid travelers and digital nomads, were able to traverse across the world simply with a valid passport. This is unimaginable today.\u201dCOVID-19 & Bureaucratic MalfeasanceNicozisis was scathing in his criticism of the health authorities and political response to the CCP virus pandemic.\u201cLooking back, I think history will show that this is really a pandemic of bureaucracies. It\u2019s really a pandemic of government,\u201d he said.Nicozisis said that up until 2020, everything in his real estate business was going great. After the lockdowns occurred, many of his tenants were forced to shut down because they couldn\u2019t pay rent. Several of them had told him that their businesses were deemed unnecessary by unelected bureaucrats.\u201cI was thinking to myself, what is going on here? Why does the vacuum cleaner guy get shut down seemingly forever and then my dollar store, which is a big corporation, explodes with customer traffic and sales?\u201d he said.He said that he has witnessed, over the last two years during the pandemic, the forced shutdowns of small businesses by what he calls \u201cbureaucratic dictate,\u201d which he believes was unconstitutional and a violation of our basic liberties.\u201cWe were all told to shop in large multinational corporations because they were deemed essential, while mom-and-pop businesses were crushed. That\u2019s not the America that I believe in. I think that if we\u2019re not careful, we\u2019re going to lose the America that we have known forever,\u201d said Nicozisis.He said that things in the United States are getting so bad that he predicts that \u201cin 2022 and 2024, there\u2019s going to be a pushback against liberal policies, and I\u2019m not necessarily talking about the typical Republican\/Democrat struggle.","521":"\"THE CHINESE VIRUS\" is killing China, know why #corona #covid19 #coronaviruspandemic","522":"Stephen Miller Mails \u201cRace-Baiting Misinformation\u201d to Asian American VotersIntercept - Asian American Voters, who could decide close elections in states like Pennsylvania, are being deluged with incendiary, misleading ads sent to their mailboxes, phones, and screens by former Trump aides, including Stephen Miller, in the closing days of the campaign.Leaders of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community in Pennsylvania have denounced the flood of digital ads and direct mail from Republican groups \u2014 which seek to blame Democrats for the spike in anti-Asian hate crimes since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic and cast efforts to combat anti-Black racism as a form of discrimination against white and Asian communities.\u201cAsian Americans, like many other communities of color and immigrant and refugee communities have had to fight through many barriers to vote \u2014 especially misinformation,\u201d Wei Chen, an organizer in the Chinese American community in Philadelphia said in an interview on Friday. \u201cThe ads are new; the tricks are not.\u201dChen, who co-founded the state\u2019s Asian Pacific Islander Political Alliance, or API PA, said that mailers from Miller\u2019s group America First Legal, falsely claiming that the Biden administration discriminates against Asian Americans, have started appearing in the Philadelphia suburbs.The flyers, which rely heavily on misleading headlines and text from right-wing news outlets, appeared after former Trump aides, who also work with Miller\u2019s foundation, produced a deeply dishonest digital ad. That ad sought to blame President Joe Biden for the rise in racist attacks on Asian Americans, which first spiked in March 2020 when then-President Donald Trump started calling Covid-19 \u201cthe Chinese virus\u201d and \u201cthe kung flu.\u201d","523":"Anti-Asian incidents spiked by 4000 percent in Trump-supporting counties following Trump\u2019s \u201cChinese virus\u201d tweets, over and above the spike observed in Clinton-supporting counties, from Andy Cao, Jason M.

I went to hospital, tested negative for Covid and after a CT scan was immediately admitted for cranial swelling.  After days in hospital I was finally sent home, only to fall ill immediately after with Covid.  December has been a really tough month for me, and I am still suffering with the after effects of covid, but somehow I survived. Infact, I am angry because 2020 was probably the worst year in my 40 years of existence. As a small business owner I had to see first hand how my business suffered due to the impact of Covid-19. I had to retrench employees. I lost contracts, and saw some of my clients close their business. Some of my clients died. I lost an indirect family. We all lost something.And as I am sitting and planning how I must deal with the extended medical bills in 2022, and the pain with the after effects of Covid, I came to wonder how this has all started and how has the WORLD just allowed CHINA to commit mass genocide. Covid started in Wuhan, China in 2019. China at first tried to cover it up like they always do, but it got out. It spread like wildfire and soon China had its first lockdown. The WORLD was quiet. The virus killed 10, then 100, then 1000, then it spread to Europe. Still the world was quiet. Some countries started with lockdowns. The Economy was wiped out. People lost their homes, their cars, their pension fund, EVERYTHING and eventually their lives. Italy at first had it worse. their population was decimated by the virus. Yet the WORLD said nothing.Then the virus made it to Africa, and South Africa. Then America, and at first the Americans denied the existence of the Virus, and then Trump called it the Chinese Virus with great resistance from Demcrats, but still the world did nothing. And as millions of Americans died, we came to realize that China has become untouchable.The World Health Organization stood by and watched how a virus took control of China, Escaped quarantine and entered the world and did nothing. Where were you WHO?? Every country in this WORLD suffered, and somehow the only country who gained from this virus was China with its cheap ventilators and face masks exports. Where economies were destroyed, the Chinese economy grew.  Yet the world did nothing.This is not the first time that China has tried to kill the World, and this is not the first time that the world stands by and watches and does nothing. When is the world going to ACT against China?Till today, Not one of China's leaders has apologized for anyone who has died due to Covid or for any family who has been wiped out due to this virus. The world just accepted that they can kill their citizens without merits, and did nothing. China is killing our planet and we are doing nothing. Where are you AMERICA, the good guys, THE UN? Why is China not sanctioned yet and why is the world still doing business with China?Where is the justice for the people who died from Covid-19.","530":"A Chinese Sword to Battle A Chinese Bug!isn\u2019t that Interesting?

Implications for Risk Mitigation StrategiesThe Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has shown that the world is being badly managed by powerful and influential countries. A virus disease breaks out in one powerful country and then spreads to other countries most of which are helpless, defenseless, and powerless. They do not know what to do to fight the disease nor do they have the resources for the fight. The virus spreads more rapidly than the catastrophic bush fires of Australia.The world is bewildered and puzzled. Is this virus a really innocent and natural outbreak of disease originated in a market of wild animals in Wuhan in China? The Chinese have been eating all sorts of domestic and wild animals (cats, dogs, bats, monkeys, snakes, squirrels, weasels, boars, pangolins, crocodiles, etc.) for thousands of years and nothing has happened to them. So why now? Is there a foul play? Has it been manufactured in a lab for biological weapons somewhere in China or outside China, for a wicked purpose?! Is it related to the Trade War (or the Cold War) between China and the U.S.A.? If so, why should the rest of the world be made to pay a very heavy price for such a foul play? #covid19 #healthcaremanagement","591":"\"If it can be West Nile Virus, then why not Wuhan Virus?\"Here in this article, I have written my opinion with facts on the above subject.

My professional and personal lives collided when my firm hosted a press conference for our pro bono client Zhanxin Gao, widower of GuiYing Ma. Mrs. Ma died on Feb. 22 from complications she suffered after being struck in the head with a rock while she was sweeping the sidewalk.. The assault, which happened Nov. 26, 2021, was just one of many attacks against Asians around the country since a former president called Covid the \"Chinese virus.\"The press conference was quickly put together as soon as we learned about Mrs. Ma's death. I was worried no one would show up. Russia just invaded Ukraine and Biden just issued economic sanctions against Russia. I wondered who would come to a press conference commemorating the life of yet another victim of Asian hate.But the family and our lawyers wanted to ensure that the media continue to cover the rising tide of anti-Asian hate in the country and that the public and the authorities tasked to keep us safe don't forget that most of us are still \"living in fear\" in America.The media turnout surprised me. Jeff Mays of the The New York Times showed up as well as other reporters at major news outlets including CNN, Fox News Media, NBC News and WNYC Radio. It was harrowing to listen to Mr. Gao lament the loss of his wife of more than 40 years. I was reminded of my aunt and uncle who often visit us from the Philippines to help take care of my sons and how I would feel if they suffered the same fate. I think of my Asian American friends and co-workers who like me no longer take the subway to work because they don\u2019t feel safe. How we constantly must look over our shoulders or ensure that we are not in anyone\u2019s way or provoke any kind of unwanted attention for fear of being attacked. By the end of the press conference, I was an emotional mess at work.Yet, I came out of the whole experience feeling empowered and seen. Our chairman was there to reaffirm our firm\u2019s commitment to \u201cpublicly call out and to work to dismantle the profound racism and xenophobia that plague our society.\u201d He promised that Paul, Weiss, one of the largest law firms in the world, would use its resources and influence to \u201cshine a spotlight\u201d on the grim reality in order to fight back against racial injustice.Our litigation partner, former U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, was there too. This is what she had to say, echoing Mr. Gao's comment about his fear of \"going out\" after the attack:\u201cWe dare not go out. He shared that fear today it is a reality for so many.In a city in a country that is built upon the work, upon the spirit, upon the soul of so many beautiful groups.We cannot let that be the reality for our elders, for our family members, for any of us.We simply cannot allow fear to rule us.Fear to diminish us.Fear to keep us all away from fulfilling our highest goals.Not here, not now and not on our watch.\u201d#stopasianhate #racialjustice #probono","614":"This summit definitely is one of the highlights of my career.

Indeed, I have tried my best to avoid talking about him. But his recent comments that have included using the \"R\" word and spouting anti-semetic tropes is inexcusable, hurtful, and must be called out.As a Jewish autistic individual, I am disgusted by this language and behaviour, and even more disgusted that people will try to defend this conduct.Firstly, his use of the \"R\" word is very outdated, harmful, and inherently dangerous to the neurodivergent community. We, in the disability community, have taken massive strides to promote inclusion, acceptance, understanding, and appreciation. We have fought for our rights to equitable and safe education, employment, and mental healthcare treatment amongst many other things. We have fought hard for many years to gain our basic human rights. This use of the \"R\" word to millions of his followers promotes hate speech against the disability community and equates us as people of severe mental incompetence. The \"R\" word implies that disabled individuals are stupid or dumb. Kanye has every right to be critical of a political figure (as does anyone), but the language he uses can have massively harmful implications for certain communities.Secondly, I am afraid that given his following and popularity, this rhetoric will lead to hate crimes and violence against both the disability and Jewish communities in the United States. This language will only embolden his followers. We have seen a large rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans, like myself, after ex-President Donald Trump's use of the terms \"Chinese-Virus\", \"China Plague\", and \"Kung-Flu\". There is every reason to fear a rise in hate speech, vandalism, terrorism, and swastikas being drawn on synagogues. It has happened many times before.","618":"29 September 2022Two recent news items on China caught my attention. The just published Pew Survey of attitudes to China in 19 advanced economies rates China at 80% - NEGATIVE! The disapproval in Australia was over 90%! Remember that when the Aussies wanted an independent enquiry into the origin of the Chinese virus, Beijing\u2019s wolf diplomats called Australia the white trash of Asia and chewing gum stuck to the boot of China. Two days ago the US Secretary of State advised Pakistan\u2019s playboy Foreign Minister to ask China for debt relief owing to the floods ravaging Pakistan. Beijing shot back that China had already given USD 50 mn in humanitarian aid to Pakistan. My Pakistani friends confirm that a few thousand overpriced moth-eaten tents, expired baby food formula and rancid drinking water have indeed been sent, most dumped into the sea that is now Pakistan. Not a word on debt relief. Should I be compelled to be a citizen of another country, China would be my 194th choice out of 193 UN member states. How do the good Chinese people accept this animosity? China will soon publish its own survey of global attitudes to China and claim an approval  rating of 142%! This is truth with Chinese characteristics! Long live PingPong!

A few days after #mayorsdams took it a step further and declared an emergency here in #nyc. I applaud both state governors and our mayor for their efforts. In doing this it enables the local government to drawdown additional #federalfunding and #suppport to deal with the crisis. While I celebrate their actions, I also want to raise up lessons learned from previous pandemics most recently the COVID pandemic but also the #HIV crisis. If you\u2019ve been following #monkeypox in the news than you are aware that it is disproportionately affecting gay & bisexual men. With rumors already spreading around government shutdowns of our clubs and gathering spaces. Whether there is validity to these rumors I would like to suggest we take a different approach. With many health agencies being caught off guard from COVID there may an initial reaction to contain the virus quickly through extreme interventions. This concept is often referred to as #publichealthabsolutism which seeks to eliminate all risk exposure, which is what we saw during COVID.So, as we move to rapidly contain the spread of the virus I want to bring awareness to another public health lever #harmreduction. #harmreduction is a concept which recognizes the difficulty in eliminating full risk exposure and instead looks to support interventions which reduce overall risk and empower the individual. Based off everything I have read, this is the approach New York is taking. Yet, the reality is, if the virus continues to spread the rumors may transform to emergency policy considerations. It\u2019s with that I want to raise up the potential risk in taking an #absolute approach.Here what's at risk.With many gay and bisexual men being estranged from their families\u2019; clubs and other spaces of gathering have been how they find #familiesofchoice and create #safespace. Similarly, the dancefloor, that is filled with throngs of people closely touching, may seem in this situation, like irresponsible behavior, but to many of us, is the only space we may feel comfortable expressing our true identities. #HIV #stigma still holds power over our community, with many internalizing the #stigma and seeing it reenforced by society. While I would like to think we wouldn't make this a gay issue, was it not just 2 years ago, a virus swept through the country with no known cause but was frequently referred to as the #chinesevirus. The resulting effect led to an increase in #hatecrimes against #chinesamericans.  So, I post the picture of my Partner and I  to remind people they know someone effected by this issue. And also encourage taking a #personcentered approach to solving this problem. #publichealth #people #localgovernment #stimgafree #harmreductionsaveslives #pride #community #lgbtq","621":"You Can't Handle the Truth !!This is a plea to all my connections within the trucking media to please assist the drivers, especially drivers with less than 1 year of experience.There has been much talk about a driver shortage and that carriers are, day in and day out, frantically searching for drivers.As many of you may know, I have, for the past 8 yrs, been in the #RecruitingTrenches as a 3rd Party recruiter, and the Dir. of Driver Development at TTJ Recruiting ... so my words here come from blood, sweat & tears assisting drivers in finding employment with #WorldClassCarriers.The drivers of this country, especially those with less than 1 yr of experience, deserve to know the #REALITY and the #TRUTH !!A few years ago, the ratio of drivers looking for OTR \/ Regional positions vs Local jobs was approx 70 \/ 30 (70% looking for OTR\/Reg ... 30% looking for Local jobs)Today that ratio has flipped  to 30 \/ 70 ... with the bulk of drivers wanting or seeking a #LOCAL job (#HomeDaily).Folks, we owe it to our industry to tell the truth ...

What about the creators - Vivek Agnihotri & Pallavi Joshi? Here are some calculations. Out of 330 Cr - 30% is straight entertainment tax. In some states (like Maharashtra), it's even 45%. But since the film was declared tax free in a lot of states, let's consider an average of 20%. So, 330 - 66 = 264 Cr. Now this BO collection is split between theatre owners and the distributors. Usually, in case of multiplexes, the split for distributors is something like 50-50 on the first week, and 42%, 37%, 30% in the following ones. With single screens, it's something like straight 70 to 90% for the distributors. Let's take an average of 60%.So, 60% of 264 Cr = 158 Cr (for distributors), 106 Cr for theatre owners.Now these 158 Cr have to be split between the distributors (in this case ZEE Studios) and the producers. These deals are complex and vary from movie to movie. The split is based on a mix of COP and COT models and Indie movies (like The Kashmir Files) usually get shitty deals (they have to shell out 20-30% while studio films give 10-12%). Seeing that Vivek Agnihotri's track record before the film wasn't too incredible, let's go with 30% for the distributors. So, 30% of 158 Cr = 48 Cr (for Zee Studios), and thus, 110 Cr for the producers.Now, the cost of making the film was:15 Cr (production) + 10 Cr (marketing): 25 CrSo, 110 Cr - 25 Cr = 85 Cr. That's what's left for the producers.Now here comes a twist. #thekashmirfilesmovie has 4 listed producers (on Wikipedia): Apart from Vivek Agnihotri and Pallavi Joshi, there's Tej Narayan Agarwal and Abhishek Agarwal as well. Now split between producers also varies from case to case, but let's assume an equal split for ease of calculations. Hence, 25% of 85 Crores = 21 Cr. That's what Agnihotri probably made (from Box Office alone) in the case of this once in a lifetime, Black Swan Success. Not counting the lifetime of passion for the project, the production of this movie began in 2019. It was supposed to be complete by 2020, but #ChineseVirus screwed everything. So it took three years to make this movie, and the fourth year gave the money back. Basically, four years to make 21 Cr. Hence, Vivek Agnihotri essentially made over 5 Cr\/year. For a movie which (according to Karan Johar) is the biggest hit on a cost to profit basis since Jai Santoshi Ma (1975). 5 Cr\/annum. Doesn't seem like a lot, if you realise this is a Black Swan success for a creative professional. There's no precedent for this kind of a success in this industry. It's unbelievable.These guys made this controversial movie, literally risking their lives, sitting on an uncertain future for over 3 years. Eventually becoming a household name like no one else.

This is great. However, as those times fade from our collective social memory we seem to be letting down our guard. #Antivaccine sentiment and #VaccineHesitancy threaten to reverse decades of progress.A challenge with quantifying lives saved due to #vaccination or #InfectionPrevention and Control is that you cannot directly measure what does not happen. We can't directly measure deaths or severe outcomes (#paralysis) averted. Make no mistake: that does not mean that they were not averted. They were. But we can never truly appreciate the gravity of what might have been. Infectious #DiseaseModeling studies can serve as a proxy estimate for negative outcomes avoided due to vaccinations. Take a look at these staggering numbers.BACKGROUND: Investments in national #immunization programs and the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (#GPEI) have resulted in substantial reductions in #ParalyticPolio worldwide. However, cases prevented because of investments in immunization programs and GPEI remain incompletely characterized.METHODS: Using a global model that integrates polio #transmission, #immunity, and vaccine #dynamics, we provide estimates of polio incidence and numbers of paralytic cases prevented. We compare the results with reported cases and estimates historically published by the World Health Organization.RESULTS: We estimate that the existence and use of #PolioVaccines prevented 5 million cases of paralytic polio for 1960\u20131987 and 24 million cases worldwide for 1988\u20132021 compared to a counterfactual world with no polio vaccines. Since the 1988 resolution to eradicate polio, our estimates suggest #GPEI prevented 2.5\u20136 million cases of paralytic polio compared to counterfactual worlds without GPEI that assume different levels of intensity of polio vaccine use in routine immunization programs.CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of historical cases provides important context for understanding and communicating the benefits of investments made in #PolioEradication. Prospective studies will need to explore the expected benefits of future investments, the outcomes of which will depend on whether and when polio is globally eradicated.Also see \"Economics of Eradication: Counting on the Polio Experience\"  for sharing Javier Casellas!#EndPolio #VaccinesWork #PublicHealth #GlobalHealth","636":"Why are the neutrals more attracted by the #antiVaccine side?

But with less than a week before the election, the platform and its users have become even more unhinged.The site, formed as Trump\u2019s alternative to Twitter after he was banned from that platform in the wake of the January 6 insurrection, is awash with false theories about how the Democratic party is attempting to manipulate the midterm vote, false claims about the attack on Paul Pelosi, Nancy Pelosi\u2019s husband, and false accusations about Democratic candidates themselves.As one of the most followed Truth Social users, Donald Trump Jr, son of the former US president, has been one of the most prominent agitators.In the run-up to the election, Trump Jr has used the platform to echo rightwing talking points about vaccines, drugs, Ukraine and a host of other issues.

Even the predicted outcome of Tuesday\u2019s US midterm elections fits a template as familiar as falling leaves. Most experts agree that the Democrats will take a hit, losing control of at least one or perhaps both chambers of Congress, because they are the incumbent party \u2013 and incumbent parties almost always suffer in midterm \u2013 and because times are unusually tough. Inflation, interest rates, petrol prices, fear of crime: they\u2019re all up. Couple that with a president set to turn 80 this month whose approval ratings have often plumbed the depths, and all the elements are in place for the Democrats to take a midterm beating, losing ground even in states they once counted as solidly their own.But look closer and you see something else. Because next week\u2019s results will decide more than just whether the red team or the blue team takes control of the House of Representatives and the Senate, on which hangs Joe Biden\u2019s ability to get things done. Next week\u2019s elections will also help determine whether, and for how much longer, the US will remain a genuine democracy.It sounds hyperbolic and that, too, is an American tradition. Candidates always tell the crowds, \u201cThis is the most important election of my lifetime\u201d and plenty will have heard Biden\u2019s warning, delivered on Wednesday, that democracy itself is on the ballot in that same spirit.

As the United States plans the country-wide rollout of 5G services, airline industry representatives and the FAA say this will impact flight services.As per the FAA ( FAA has found that the risk to the flying public justifies foregoing notice and comment prior to adoption of this rule because radio altimeter anomalies that are undetected by the aircraft automation or pilot, particularly close to the ground, could lead to loss of continued safe flight and landing.

On the surface, it's easy to assume that worries about inflation, recession,  et al. are driving the recent layoffs and losses from traditionally strong companies. So I dug in and found some interesting trends. Current layoff\/loss drivers can be grouped into three basic categories: Past, Present and Future conditions \u2014 happening simultaneously in a rare convergence.Past Conditions:This is where layoffs have traditionally been most frequent, caused by miscalculations, mistakes, excessive debt. Over time these issues come to a head - with layoffs used as an attempt to right the financial boat. Shopify miscalculated e-commerce growth, GoPuff's business model was never going to generate sustainable profits, Glossier underestimated the importance of brick and mortar and Office Depot failed to respond to consumer and market realities for decades. Victoria's Secret was long overdue in addressing culture change and Tesla is just trying to survive Elon Musk. Unless companies in this category can reset their north star and rebuild around new systems, more layoffs will ensue.Present Conditions:We've had moments in history where events or conditions developed quickly, needing immediate change to navigate - with 2007 (recession) and 2020 (Covid) being most recent. Housing based businesses like Zillow, RedFin, Remax and Loan Depot are feeling interest rate driven market slowdowns. Spotify, Netflix, Carvana are in optimization mode in response to softening sales due to inflation\/recession fears. Companies like CVS, Unilever and H&M had steady sales around recession proof offerings but are seeing profits drop due to new consumer trends, new competition or climate change movements converging over a relatively short period of time. These companies are still healthy but under shareholder pressure or lacking a large war chest, layoffs and cost reductions are necessary. Unless reductions are paired with reorganization to avoid being run over by a new competitor's better CX and more flexible profit model, these companies may be on a weaker path forward.Future Conditions:This is the best reason for layoffs and an indicator that company leadership has their eye on long term success. Like horse sellers in the time of Henry Ford, almost all business sectors today are approaching a point where innovation is triggering the need to replace old systems\/old tech\/old models. Social media has accelerated the pace of change and consumers are quicker to embrace new tech. Companies should focus on removing departmental silos, integrating channels, strengthening brand value and making every area of operations more flexible. Walmart is restructuring their leadership around a stronger omni-channel model, Best Buy is rebalancing their online and offline capabilities, Ford and GM are restructuring for the coming EV market and Nokia is setting themselves up around 5G. #retailstrategy #tri2022","687":"I just rewatched David Brown's re:Invent 2021 talk on networking and the scale of AWS continues to blow me away. are my notes from the talk:AWS first 5 years: 4 regionsAWS next 5 years: 7 more regionsAWS last 5 years: 14 more regionsAWS n+1 years: 9 more regions coming soon (or 8 now?)AWS's Global Backbone is 100GbE fiber owned and managed by AWS. Major investments in transoceanic cables like Marea, Jupiter, and Hawaiki.But David doesn't like talking about that because \"it should just work.\" - which is an absolutely absurd statement when you consider there's a 9000 mile long cable, carrying terabits of global internet traffic.In 15 years of EC2 networking:2008 - EIP, custom hardware, blackfoot devices (named after penguins)2009 - 1ms NAT translation layers2010 - Custom top of rack switches, simple - do one thing well, highly available2011 - 10gbps, then 100gbps, now we have 400gbps top of rack2013 - 460 tbps and one-way latency of 12 microseconds2019 - 10k tbps, or ten petabits, 7 microseconds2021 - 11 trillion events\/metrics per day for AWS networkingCovid-19 caused a 400% increase in AWS networking throughput over a matter of days.Original EC2 instances had a xen hypervisor-based networking virtualization - so a networking latency of 200-300ms but now we have nitro that offloads all of this. AWS is the only cloud provider that can give you 100% of the underlying compute - because of nitro.2021 - 50gbps baseline ec2 outbound and 800gbps for HPCDirect Connect now supports 100gbps ports (and MACsec)SRD - provides 15-microsecond latency and smooths traffic flow across routers - nitro cards responsible for figuring out packet order.In 2022 SRD on ENA will provide a 300% single flow bandwidth improvement.Security:All traffic is encrypted over the wire.

Thank you for your continued participation\".Over that time, it became clear to me that which theories they fall prey to had nothing to do with intelligence or usually discernment (not among friends of mine, anyway) because I saw very, very smart people get less and less discerning about information and getting increasing sure they were getting \"the truth\" in spite of it not holding up under scrutiny in my experience.Because I saw the same people fall for similar clusters of misinformation (or disinformation) I began to assume it was the result of the content flows they were consuming. Maybe it was FOX News, maybe it was certain related blogs, maybe it was Facebook groups, maybe it was certain Telegram channels, maybe it was Infowars.com, etc. I started using the phrase \"falling down a misinformation hole\". As in, \"they've fallen down a misinformation hole\" using the rabbit hole metaphor.But in listening to Beau From the Fifth Column on youtube - who puts out at least one video a day breaking down current political dynamics and events - he offered a term that really serves as an apt metaphor:Information Silos.And just like a grain silo, once you fall into it, it is very hard to get out, and you can easily get pulled into it and suffocate and die (in this case, become metaphorically brain dead as it is a dark, downward trend).Maybe you have someone like this in your life. They have fixated on a particular theory and get lost in it. And because you are open-minded, you might consider it and check it out, but you end up discarding it because you have a discerning mind but more so - and this is the critical part - you acquire your information from multiple news sources and multiple outlets, independent or otherwise.I'll put a few links in the comments that are relevant, but here is a graph that really highlights the overlap of misinformation and distortion, and \"information silos\".","689":"The wait is finally over as the much-awaited telecommunication technology, 5G, was unveiled by PM Modi on 2nd October 2022 for the Indian market. The technology, as claimed, will occupy the center stage in making India a five trillion-dollar economy. But at the ground level, how will 5G improve the situation? In this post, I intend to answer this very question.Let\u2019s look at some of the points where 5G would improve our lives:1.    EducationLooking at the current reforms in distance learning, such as the launch of 200 TV channels dedicated to education, 5G can improve such causes by leaps and bounds. With high internet speeds, children can learn with modern tools like AR and VR, which can be the onset of a digital classroom. People going for higher education can also get practical knowledge through simulations.2.Healthcare and pharmaThe medical sector, in my opinion, is the most data-driven and generating industry. 5G supports IoT devices like smartwatches, with which we can monitor patients' health and in case of any emergency, alert the concerned authorities. 5G can also help with creating and accessing digital medical records.5G, with its low latency, can be used in automating the pharmaceutical industry and some medical procedures, so that in cases like COVID, doctors can help patients without any risk.3.Daily life5G would play a pivotal role in the concepts of smart cities and smart homes. With improved surveillance and monitoring of situations, authorities can better deploy forces in cases of high traffic or any other emergency.Also, for recreational activities, 5G can help with ultra-HD movie streaming, and also realize the dream of the metaverse wherein we can have virtual concerts, live streaming of matches, etc.In addition to this, the online shopping industry would benefit a lot from this as they can improve customer experience using their platforms.4.ManufacturingThe manufacturing industry would immensely benefit from 5G. It is the backbone of IoT, through which we can automate a sizeable portion of the processes and improve quality control, which optimizes resource usage, minimize wastage and smoothen the process for the ever-growing demand. Likewise, 5G would also improve inventory management.5.LogisticsWith connected vehicles, companies would be better equipped to allocate vehicles and other resources. They can reduce fuel consumption, saving both money and environmental damage caused in the last mile delivery of services. For personal vehicles, 5G can help with the idea of self-drive cars and smart-traffic signals can be a reality. With the growing popularity of EVs, we can have a network of cars and infrastructure to share information about the location and health of the battery. I would also improve the time taken for emergency services to reach the sight of the accident.If you have any other idea on how 5G will help us, do share in the comment section.#technology #5g #india #people #iot","690":"Why is Covid out of control again?Most of the data is on the Government Websites, but you can see that the vast majority of the hospital admissions are from those (largely selfish though a tiny minority can't help it) people who have not been vaccinated.

To the people who think that Covid is just a conspiracy theory - or that 5G networks have caused it - please please get your heads out of the sand and do the right thing.","691":"I finally got to meet again with the Singapore Aerospace Manufacturing (SAM) team in Penang, Malaysia in December last year. This was a long-awaited visit after a 2-year break due to the pandemic, and I was very happy to see for myself how they have managed to pull through the COVID-19 pandemic, capitalising on the extraordinary growth of the semiconductor industry.The COVID-19 crisis resulted in one of the largest global shocks in the aerospace industry\u2019s history. Global and regional air travel restrictions caused a significant passenger traffic slump, leading to grounded planes and airlines cancelling orders for new aircraft, while at the same time causing havoc in the supply chain. Major aerospace manufacturers and suppliers that were used to long-term stability and multi-year orderbooks have to suddenly deal with disruptions in production, financial pressure, and slow demand. This presented a significant challenge to many companies\u2019 revenue and cashflow. SAM was no exception \u2014 in the beginning, at least.The digitalisation of global economies and industries proved to be a silver lining for SAM. Increased deployment of 5G technologies, as well as uptakes in investments in data centers and cloud services has increased global demand for chip shipments and semiconductor device fabrication. With the guidance of its management, SAM managed to successfully pivot by expanding its range of innovative engineering solutions and cutting-edge capabilities to serve the semiconductor industry.Navigating the pandemic is a challenging task, and SAM has worked exceptionally hard to stay ahead of the crisis. Great work, and a big thank you to everyone at SAM for your efforts and contributions. With your dedication and hard work, I am sure SAM will see more successes in the future.","692":"The Economist [excerpt]: It will be an orderly affair. From October 16th the grandees of #China\u2019s Communist Party will gather in the Great Hall of the People in #Beijing for their five-yearly congress. Not a teacup will be out of place; not a whisper of protest will be audible. The Communist Party has always been obsessed with control. But under President #XiJinping that obsession has deepened. After three decades of opening and reform under previous leaders, China has in many ways become more closed and autocratic under Mr Xi. Surveillance has broadened. Censorship has stiffened. Party cells flex their muscles in private firms. Preserving the party\u2019s grip on power trumps any other consideration.This is evident in Mr Xi\u2019s response to covid-19. China\u2019s initial lockdown saved many lives. However, long after the rest of the world has learned to live with the virus, China still treats every case as a threat to social stability. When infections crop up, districts and cities are locked down. Compulsory movement-tracking apps detect when citizens have been near an infected person, and then bar them from public spaces. ...Some hope that, once the congress is over, a plan for relaxing the zero-covid policy may be unveiled. But there is no sign yet of the essential first steps to avoid mass deaths, such as many more vaccinations, especially of the old. Party propaganda suggests that any loosening is a long way off, regardless of the misery and economic mayhem that lockdowns cause. The policy has failed to adapt because no one can say that Mr Xi is wrong, and Mr Xi does not want China to be dependent on foreign vaccines, even though they are better than domestic ones.Such control-freakery has wider implications for China and the world. At home Mr Xi makes all the big calls, and a fierce machinery of repression enforces his will. Abroad, he seeks to fashion a global order more congenial for autocrats. To this end, China takes a twin-track approach. It works to co-opt international bodies and redefine the principles that underpin them. Bilaterally, it recruits countries as supporters. Its economic heft helps turn poorer ones into clients; its unsqueamishness about abuses lets it woo despots; and its own rise is an example to countries discontented with the American-led status quo. ...Rightly, the West finds this alarming. No despotic regime in history has had resources to match modern China\u2019s. And unlike the leader of a democracy, Mr Xi can snap his fingers and deploy them. If he wants China to dominate technologies such as artificial intelligence or drugs, public and private funds pour into research. Size and single-mindedness can produce results: China is probably ahead of the West in such fields as 5g and batteries. The more powerful its economy grows, the greater its geopolitical muscle is likely to be. This is especially so if it can dominate certain key technologies, make other countries depend on it and set standards that lock them in.#news","693":"MS Dhoni's leadership skill and global manufacturers. Eager to know what it is?With the shortage of semiconductors, Covid has provided considerable hurdles to many prominent manufacturing sectors, pushing them to forcibly halt or do partial production.You might wonder how MS Dhoni is connected to notable industry Giants?Yes, there is a primary reason for that, indeed.Here are the glimpses of the mind game by Mr. Cricket by predicting the future:India and Pakistan's match at the 2007 T20 World Cup ended in a tie, and as there were no super overs at the time, situations like this were resolved by bowling out.India managed to hit the stumps in the first three attempts and Pakistan missed their first three attempts resulting in a glorious first T20 World Cup victory for the Men in Blue.Later, MS Dhoni disclosed his strategies for getting ready for the bowl-out scenario. He said, \u201cWe were aware of the bowl-out and prepared for it every day after warm-up.\u201d They were doing it for fun, but it was clear that the player who gets the most hit would be bowling in the actual bowl-out.This proved why Dhoni is one of the greatest minds in cricket because he was even prepared for a situation like this during the World Cup. Resilient Manufacturing - Able to overcome the unexpected(\u201cAlways have Plan B\u201d)The semiconductor industry is a crucial component of today\u2019s global economy.During pandemic there is a massive buying surge for laptops and other electronic devices due to WFH and home school. And then demand of chips also driven by new technologies, 5G services, cloud and AI services. At the same time global lockdown causing labour shortage which further surge the semiconductor shortagesLeading manufacturing giants missed their trick in predicting the semiconductor shortages and which forces them to stop production or do partial production. They were not able to give products to the customer when required. It is estimated that as many as 169 sectors are affected due to this semiconductor crisis and this crisis may last up to 1st quarter of 2023. Now many countries started developing their own semiconductor manufacturersThe semiconductor shortage, which cost global manufacturers 4% of total sales for 2021, cuttingUS$60bnin revenue from the industry, has and continues to be a turbulent disruption for the automotive manufacturing industry\u201cWhen you have exhausted all possibilities, remember this: You haven\u2019t\u201d.

Although companies still seek profitability, never before have the concepts of corporate purpose, respect, and encouragement for diversity, and engagement been so propagated and encouraged.Why am I posting this here on LinkedIn?I'm not trying to criticize anyone, I'm just opening the debate: In our society, is it still possible to have someone who lives inside the box but thinks outside of it? or should we think and live outside of the box?Honestly, I don't think we should go back to living in Plato's Cave or the Croods' Cave. I advocate that living outside the 'caves' is to understand that the pandemic of Covid 19 was not the cause of the main changes that we are living, but certainly, it has been the earthquake that destroyed all caves: Either we live outside, or we die crushed inside!#recruiters #talentacquisition #hr #jobhiring #diversity #respect #5g #society #internetofthings","698":"Data and analytics leaders should include these in their planning for successful strategies.

The reason was that they taught things that contradicted God\u2019s truth (John 8:44) (Mark 7:1-23).This is why Paul said that if anyone offers a different Gospel, let them be cursed (Galatians 1:8).Regrettably, due to being deceived by the false Christ, The Pope is at the forefront of the unbiblical call for world peace.The truth is that Jesus never came to bring peace to humanity to stop wars, crimes, or any evil. He came to bring a sword to divide who will follow Him only from those who will walk behind everything else (Matthew 10:34-39).Understand that Satan is using the Pope and the like to help establish the one-world religion for the Antichrist who will bring the mark of the beast\u2014the guarantee of everlasting fire.Make no mistake.The world is shaping up for the wrath of God.

This is a personality, entity, or a being energized by satan himself to imitate everything Christ ever represents in strength, power, relevance, and even signs and wonders. Satan has some power but only the power that God allows him to have. The Bible says he will perform great signs and many more.Revelation 13:11-14 Then I saw a second beast, coming out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb, but it spoke like a dragon. 12It exercised all the authority of the first beast on its behalf, and made the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose fatal wound had been healed. 13And it performed great signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to the earth in full view of the people. 14Because of the signs it was given power to perform on behalf of the first beast, it deceived the inhabitants of the earth. It ordered them to set up an image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived.This is just a guess by me but I think these signs will be fake or at least most of them. With the technology we have today, we can make things look real. Check out this hologram using 5G technology at a baseball game. has His Son Jesus and satan will have his son the antichrist. Not exactly in the same way as God Has His Son because Jesus is God incarnate. The devil is a copycat. He will have his own version of Jesus.

Such a person is the antichrist\u2014denying the Father and the Son. The antichrist is a being that is in open rebellion against God and His Purposes. In a literal sense we can say he is the enemy of God. However, as established in The Bible his season and time of manifestation are in the last days. In Christian Eschatology (last days of prophecy in The Bible) there are several events that are associated with the last days. There are so many happenings and events ranging from the pouring out of God's Spirit upon all flesh. It is Written in Joel 2:28 \u201cAnd afterward, I will pour out my Spirit on all people.

It also says not to be swayed by anyone who says differently. This includes even famous preachers and theologians of today who say otherwise.2nd Thessalonians 2:1-4 Now, brethren, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him, we ask you, not to be soon shaken in mind or troubled, either by spirit or by word or by letter, as if from us, as though the day of Christ had come.

Later, the same group found Him, and here is what He told them. \u201cMost assuredly, I say to you, you seek Me, not because you saw the signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were filled.\u201d \u2014John 6:26Sadly, the pack wasn\u2019t concerned with following Christ nor truly helping others who do the same.Regrettably, because of selfishness, many who claim to follow Christ actually pursue self, completely missing the mandate of the Savior, which requires selfless servitude towards Him and the Brethren.As Jesus was nearing the Cross, fully aware who would deny Him three times, the Messiah declared some of the most unselfish words.Warning and encouraging His Disciple Peter, who would soon renounce ever knowing Him, He says, \u201cSimon, Simon! Indeed, Satan has asked for you that he may sift you as wheat. But I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail; and when you have returned to Me, strengthen your brethren.\u201d \u2014Luke 22:31-32Christ, knowing the storm God was following Satan to send Peter\u2019s way, would be difficult. But instead of telling him to seek God for blessings and miracles, Jesus prayed that Peter\u2019s faith would hold up and that once he was transformed, he would return to his brothers\u2014serving just as He did.The author and finisher of the Faith (Hebrews 12:2) showed the children of God one of the fundamentals of the Faith. At the beginning and end of the day, it\u2019s not about the person but instead the purpose of God. And His purpose is that we relevantly encourage each other who follow Jesus, especially as we see the Day of the Lord approaching (Hebrews 10:25).\u201cBut he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.\u201d \u2014Matthew 23:11#ServantLeadership #Discipleship #Gospel #Biblical #Truth #TeamJesus #Yahweh #BeTheDifference","759":"God's Final WARNING > The Final Hour is Here >1st John 2:18 Children, it is the last hour, and as you have heard that antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists have come.

I am very grateful and thankful for this. We are living in the last days which means The Bible tells us what it is going to look like in the last days and what it looks like right now is evil is being called good and good is being called evil. Isaiah 5:20 Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter.2 Timothy 3:1-5 But understand this, that in the last days there will come times of difficulty.

That is also how he operates. Coming to us when we are at our lowest points. He came to tempt Jesus 3 times and 3 times he failed because Our King used The Word of God against the devil.He told Jesus what the scripture says in Matthew 4:6 \u201cIf you are the Son of God,\u201dhe said, \u201cthrow yourself down. For it is written: \u201c\u2018He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.\u201dSatan told the truth here from scripture but it is a dangerous deceit and lie. If you hear any lie that is close to the truth it is easy to fall into it. The devil is the father of deception and lying is his native tongue.John 8:44You belong to your father, the devil,and you want to carry out your father\u2019s desires.He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.He Loves to add truth with hints of lies mixed together. He won't come out with a full blown lie. That is why the antichrist will be revealed as a man of peace. Some people think that the antichrist will be an ugly evil looking man with horns poking out of his head. The Spirit of the antichrist is already here and it has been for quite some time. We know that from reading this scripture. 1 John 4:3 But every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world.1st Timothy 4:1-2 The Spiritclearly says that in later timessome will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spiritsand things taught by demons.2Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron.Doctrines of the devil and his henchmen are leading thousands of people daily to hell. To be truthful to you if you believe any of these lies and and you act according to them the eternal life that Christ grants to his sheep will not be yours.

Secondly, mRNA molecules are non-infectious, and mRNA vaccines have the potential to induce both humoral and cell-mediated immunity. Lastly, the production of mRNA vaccines is fast and inexpensive.Not one, two or four trials.

The study follows the flat Earth echo chamber on YouTube to understand how they weave their arguments. We find that disinformation circulates through identity-based grievances and grudges that solidify viewpoints. Their argument resists fact-checking because it stokes victimization (pathos) and group identification (ethos).Key Takeaways: Disinformation is more than facts vs falsehoods (#fakenews); it is an adversarial campaign that weaponizes multiple rhetorical strategies and forms of knowing\u2014including falsehoods, truths, half-truths, and value-laden judgments\u2014to exploit and amplify identity-driven controversies.

For months I thought about the potential cure of the COVID-19 Pandemic.  What if science could create a variant several times as infectious as the Delta variant, which in less than six months now  causes up to 99% of cases in many  parts of the globe? One that is programmed to be infectious but nonvirulent, one that causes no more than cold-like symptoms.  Folks vaccinated would have great immunity to it and those unvaccinated, even those antivaxxers, would get their wish, immunity through infection, but without the risk of dying from the more harmful variants of COVID.According to doctors in South Africa, who noted an explosion of COVID cases over the past few weeks, the new variant appears to be less virulent and spreading most quickly among those who are unvaccinated.  The goal of any virus is survival. And a random mutation that results in greater transmission is the ultimate winner, not the one that kills the most people. Whether it is the luck of the draw, the randomness of the most infectious mutation, or perhaps the engineering of a COVID virus that will completely dominate others, I suggest this is the only answer to ending the pandemic. #Omicron #COVID","809":"Antivaxxing kills.

They\u2019re all getting vaccine! I dare COVID to kill me.\u201d* After Weldon\u2019s death, her QAnon allies threatened to pursue violent action against staff at the hospital where she died. Scott McKay, a QAnon personality known as the\u201cPatriot Streetfighter,\u201dsaid he would publicize the names of doctors and nurses involved in treating Weldon, saying he wanted to \u201cput the fear into these medical professionals\u201d in a Telegram post. McKay proposed the hospital staff be sentenced to death, or be murdered in vigilante violence. \u201cIf it\u2019s not done in a military tribunal then it\u2019s going to be done in the street eventually and not to my wishes,\u201d McKay wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s my greatest fear.

It's easy enough to chuckle about flat-earthers, but with the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change rearing its ugly head, denying science has never been so dangerous. So, what can you do if that science denier is someone you care about, maybe even someone in your family? Lee McIntyre, a research fellow at the Center for Philosophy and History of Science at Boston University, decided to explore this topic in a new book called: How to Talk to a Science Denier: Conversations with Flat Earthers, Climate Deniers, and Others Who Defy Reason.\"see also: \"How to Debate a Science Denier: A new finding shows that marshaling facts and identifying an opponent\u2019s rhetorical techniques are effective at dampening a skeptic\u2019s message\" spoke to Quirks & Quarks' host Bob McDonald about how science deniers construct and defend their beliefs with evidence-based insights into how to change their minds. The interview below has been edited and condensed.You write in your book that there's a common script behind all science denial reasoning, and that if we know the script, we can change it. So, what is the script? Q. You write in your book that there's a common script behind all science denial reasoning, and that if we know the script, we can change it. So, what is the script? A. This script was discovered by Mark and Chris Hoofnagle, and it was developed further by John Cook and Stephen Lewandowsky, who are cognitive scientists and it goes like this: there are five tropes of science denial reasoning.Every science denier cherry picks data, believes in conspiracy theories, engages in illogical reasoning, relies on fake experts and denigrates real experts and here's my favourite: that science has to be perfect in order to be credible. Now, if you understand that script, you're way ahead of the game. There was a study in Nature Human Behavior in June of 2019 which vindicated that model. It's called, \"technique rebuttal,\" and I was very gratified to see that that was really the first empirical evidence to show that it could be effective in convincing science deniers to give up their beliefs. #climatedeniers #techniquerebuttal#science #sciencedenial #antivaxxers","839":"Oh, yes, I am Day 4 into Covid + self isolation.

Go to the father\u2019s Twitter feed and it\u2019s the usual story: he warnsfollowers that governments have \u201cradicalised\u201d, that Pfizer jabsare perilous and long Covid isan invention, then tweets casually that he has tested positive, before his feed suddenly goes silent, for ever. Many vaccinated people enjoy mocking deaths like his. That\u2019s harsh. We all make wrong choices every day, but they don\u2019t usually kill us. Above all, though, vaxenfreude, as it\u2019s now called, ignores the people left behind. The worst harm that antivaxxers do is to their families, whom they expose to daily danger and then sometimes plunge into a grief that cannot speak its name. The harm will reverberate down the generations. How will it shape the millions of bereaved and their relationship to the rest of us?For most inhabitants of rich countries, Covid-19 is no longer lethal, but for the voluntarily unvaccinated, it\u2019s a slaughter they don\u2019t understand. Their risk of Covid-related death is 14 times that of vaccinated people, says Rochelle Walensky, director of the US\u2019s Centers for Disease Control. Just between June and November, 163,000 Covid-19 deaths in the US alone could have been prevented by vaccination, estimates the Kaiser Family Foundation. That\u2019s nearly double all the American deaths in war in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq combined \u2014 and the unvaccinated continue to die, pointlessly. For each unvaccinated American death, about nine people lose a grandparent, parent, sibling, spouse or child. Probably the most distressing thing about Covid-19 is its relentless orphaning, which recalls the HIV epidemic in Africaor the Great Flu of 1918. Think of the children of Kevin and Misty Mitchem, a couple in their forties who chose not to be vaccinated and who died of Covid within days of each other in October.\"","845":" Listen to the second episode of the Intelligence Brief #Podcast from our colleagues at HENSOLDT Analytics!This time with the topic:Anti-vaxxers & Conspiracies: Monitoring the spread of Covid-19-related disinformation.Podcast host Anne-Lynn D., is joined by Shayan Sardarizadeh - a BBC Monitoring and BBC journalist who investigates disinformation, conspiracy theories, cults and extremism.

Take home message: Especially if you h ave cancer and even if you're currently getting immunotherapy - get vaccinated.  find a summary for non-specialists here:  our publication we describe phenomena which may misguide clinicians into believing their patients are at risk for a severe adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination while under cancer immunotherapy. This is important because a wrong diagnosis may lead to unnecessary disruption\/termination of a cancer therapy our patients so desperately need. On the other hand correctly identify these 'false flags' will potentially allow patients to continue with cancer immunotherapy.Our paper also responds to a previous publication describing preliminary results (case report) which we addressed in our clinical trial. Unfortunately, this previous publication has been weaponized by antivaxxers and conspiracy theorists to misguide patients into believing vaccines are dangerous under cancer immunotherapy and that this outweighs the benefits of the vaccine (check social media and coverage by Chinese state media for yourself:  This is of course untrue, was never suggested by the previous study and  our clinical trial further supports the safety of COVID vaccines under immunotherapy. Counteracting this false information was one of the main motivations for me to publish our study as early as possible (I submitted the preprint on 24th December 2021). Even though it is clear to me that people who have fully entered the COVID conspiracy world will not return easily.

A section of my PhD research was trawling through 45 years of studies into the 'benefits of technology in the classroom' and looking for the repeated, systemic flaws in methods. I was trying to explain why so many studies report positive results for classroom tech programs, yet, when taken as whole, educational outcomes have not changed much. So I have a pretty sharp eye for dodgy data set, intended or not.Calling BS goes beyond just spotting dodgy data. Bergstrom and West go on to explore how to call it out in a way that improves the situation,  not simply hardens people's resolve \"to be right.\" Given my recent encounters with people telling me COVID does not exist, or that vaccines are not effective, my patience on responding respectfully is thin, at best. That BS is killing people: family members of friends and workmates.

With that I decided that\u2019s it I had enough, I notified my dad and he acknowledged my paranormal experience.I look around the room and found my brother and sister sound asleep after the long day trip.My dad sat up in a lotus cross leg position with both palm clasped together he started chanting the buddhist prayer of Great Compassion mantra by the Guan Yin Bodhisattva aka Goddes of Mercy.After he had chanted a few times, my dad checked with me again whether I am still feeling any paranormal disturbances.I replied that I felt better and no more disturbances on my feet when sleeping on the mattress. When the paranormal disturbances finally stopped, I managed to get some sorely needed rest and sleep.Later on we checked out and drove back home. This was my sharing of real paranormal experience while having a family vacation at Genting Highlands Malaysia and hope you all have enjoyed reading it or maybe able to relate to your own encounters.

I am an old man who has seen so many documentaries about the whole thing over the decades. Three different people swear they saw a bullet hole in the front windshield and they testified it very clearly came from the front.  One was a nurse who walked next to the car as she entered the hospital to work before the car was re-parked farther away.  She saw the windshield and front dashboard. Another was a secret service agent ordered to take the car to a custom glass lab at the Ford factory and ordered to witness the destruction and replacement of the windshield. The third was a man who worked in the custom glass lab. Then there is a family in Dallas I had personal knowledge of.  Their story never has been in any documentary.  They made a film from behind the car that showed 3 men on the railroad bridge in front of the car. Two men spread the crowd on the bridge while a third man stepped between them and fired a rifle. This family's film was taken by the FBI who had found out about it from visiting all photo labs in the area. Then there was the man behind the fence at the back of the grassy knoll who was witnessed leaving after there was a sound and a puff of smoke and he handed off his rifle to someone else as he left the area.Then their are the to 2 caskets. JFK left Dallas in 1 casket and arrived in a completely different casket with his head and hair altered.Then there are the pieces of brains that flew back across the back of the car. (indicative of a shot from the front or front\/side) Jackie said she climbed onto the back of the car to retrieve them because she though maybe they could put his brains back together or something to that effect.Then there is the direction his head moves.   Many decades ago it moved different. Now days, absolutely every film I see has been altered.  You just have to take my word on this one.  I remember decades ago when it looked different. Maybe there are a few others out there that remember the original film sequence also.Then there is the thing with officer Tippit outside the movie theater. A witness saw two men approach Tippit and one of them shot him. Then they both got out of sight at opposite ends of the street. Oswald wasn't around because he was already in the theater just like his boss at the CIA told him.Oswald's girl friend confirmed they both worked for the CIA and both were trained together on a mission to overdose Castro with an x-ray machine but the circumstances\/project never worked out.There is so much more evidence it was other people I could write a book right here.#jfkassassination #jfk #johnfkennedy #presidentkennedy #conspiracy #leeharveyoswald #americanhistory #thekennedys #deepstate #conspiracytheories #conspiracytheorist #assassination #jfkresearch  #booksofinstagram #trineday #jackiekennedy  #history #jackiekennedystyle #jackiekennedyonassis #texasschoolbookdepository","913":"I think it should be assumed that Trump still has #GovernmeDocuments, particularly concerning #Russiagate, squirrelled away somewhere based on reports that he repeatedly commented to staff that he had to save those documents from falling into the hands of the #DeepState, and his comments after the search that the #FBI did not find the Russiagate documents for which they were looking.

The space capsule, thought to be of Chinese origin, suddenly hurtled out of the sky and smashed into the beach just where Jon was standing.   Said Jon today, \u201cI was minding my own business, admiring the beautiful beach at Portmellon in Cornwall and posing for a photo, when BANG!\"  Fortunately, Jon quickly stepped away from the path of the UFO with only seconds to spare.  \"I caught a glimpse of this huge chunk of smouldering metal with flashing lights fall out of the clouds and headed straight for me,\" said Jon, still shaking from the experience.  \"I had the shock of my life and couldn't believe what was happening. It's not every day you stand on a beach and see a space rocket speeding from the sky in your direction.\"Jon says he is suspicious that the UFO could be of Chinese origin.\"For one thing police officers were on the beach within minutes of the object crashing,\" said Jon. \"They started to cart it away and one officer let slip that this was a secret operation code-named 'Chinese takeaway'.\"\"I also saw Chinese writing on the side of the space capsule,\" added Jon. \"I have no idea what it said.\"The message on the side of the UFO was: \u79bb\u5f00\u6b27\u76df\u592a\u611a\u8822\u4e86\u3002Said Jon, \"I will never, ever forget what happened to me on the morning of 1st April 2018.\" If you like this post and you're on Twitter, retweet.

Seen in some circles as far too risky, others advocate that we may be left with very few choices and that we should at least understand the options -- their opportunities and risks -- much better.In the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Congress directed the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), in coordination with relevant Federal agencies, to develop a five-year \u2013 \u201cscientific assessment of solar and other rapid climate interventions in the context of near-term climate risks and hazards.\" Although OSTP is not issuing a Federal Register Notice, there isan informal, open comment period.Deadline Sept 9. members of the public can provide up to 1,000 words, without graphics or attachments, on the four areas called out in the legislation: \"(1) the definition of goals in relevant areas of scientific research; (2) capabilities required to model, analyze, observe, and monitor atmospheric composition; (3) climate impacts and the Earth\u2019s radiation budget; and (4) the coordination of Federal research and investments to deliver this assessment to manage near-term climate risk and research in climate intervention.\" #climatechange #geoengineering #research #scienceandtechnology #earthscience","976":"My thoughts on the #geoengineering risks of our current #climate trajectory.

Unfortunately, coaches and parents seem to forget about the key messages when the match starts.","Whether it is sports or anything else in life, having fun and being a part of something bigger is more important than always looking at others as competition. It's how most people end up in a rat race, being concerned with others view them\/how they look, rather than what matters more being truthful to themselves, being kind\/compassionate, all those lessons from the good book. It's cliche to say this but parents do try to live vicariously through their kids sometimes. They make their kids victories their victories, and unknowingly can add too much pressure on their own kids to succeed, on the Coaches and just create a hostile environment over something that was meant to be enjoyable.  It's healthy to get out of ones own head and be an adult, who is there just to support their children (win, lose or draw). This is their moment. Let them experience it. If they lose, they learn. If they draw, no worries. If they win, they celebrate; hopefully by picking up on their losses, they also learn to be gracious winners and maintain humility.

I had the great fortune just yesterday to coach (as a volunteer) two young tennis players  who won the Illinois State High School Doubles Championship. In general, everyone (players, parents, officials) was fantastic. I think, while not all inclusive, much comes down to communication. I personally developed a great relationship with the parents and we were able to have comfortable (even with difficult topics) conversations to set the tone. And, the officials, before the start of every day, discussed sportsmanship, the role of spectators, etc. And, a couple of times, the officials had to have difficult conversations with spectators, but the fact that \u2018the stage was set\u2019 up front on how to handle issues, made everything manageable.

Ivermectin (an anti-parasitic) seems most beneficial in areas that have higher rates of parasitic infections. Many such infections are kept in check by the immune systems, but are likely to flare up when the immune system is disrupted by COVID19, or by the steroids that have become standard of care for COVID19.So it seems likely that the benefits of ivermectin (an anti-parasitic) is in treating underlying parasite infections.This is not definitive evidence yet, but would explain a lot.\u2026see more","I prefer to listen to the doctors who are in the front line treating patients and getting good results with Ivermectin (see FLCCC).","Thanks for posting John.

People would do well to reflect on the benign social arrangements that do exist today and the number of other vaccines that have been administered in the past which limit disease on a global basis. The distrust in MMR vaccines amongst parents today has led to the diseases gaining a foothold once more, after decades of suppression. It does seem that no matter how good it gets, there's always someone who feels the need to complain and assert their God-given freewill. On occasions they might be the ones who are right - that is what I'm most frightened about.The sad thing missing is Trust in Public Life, where people would rather trust their own logic than that of the collective surrounding them.

You make totally good points and I would be onboard with them if the majority of the people that are against vaccines were following extra safety protocols, but here in the U.S. there are so many that still think the virus is a hoax and will not voluntarily take precautions putting more of us in jeopardy.

They do however have to deal with the consequences of not being vaccinated in the midst of a global emergency where one of the most effective tools to mitigate the devastation it is causing are vaccines. Call them mandates. Call them choices. The main point is that we all have a social responsibility to reduce harm and do all we can to get through this 2 year interdependent predicament we are in.I\u2019m an epidemiologist by training and have never felt that anyone has to get vaccinated. However, getting angry that one\u2019s options are reduced when choosing not to, is childish and pretty selfish and entitled. I ask that people deal with their choice.

It adds fuel to the fire by further convincing conspiracy theorists that the gov't just wants control, and we risk losing stacks of frontline workers that we need.All that said, I am pro-vaccination, but the gov't and the NHS have failed to engage those people. Someone's engaged them. Someone's pushed the buttons, sown seeds of doubt, and persuaded them not to trust the vaccine.The solution has to lie in re-education. Telling people they will lose their jobs if they're not vaccinated won't work and is losing public support. Telling them that they must attend a full-day seminar to learn all about vaccinology, virology, immunology, and the chance to talk directly with experts in the field is a different matter.

(1) Viruses do not, cannot mutate spontanouusly because they are not alive & have no mechanism to reproduce.The mutations occur in the host cells due to transcription errors on the host cell ribosme. The bigger the population the bigger the total number of virusues in that popultion and so the bigger the chance of of mutants. (2) No country had the resources to make enough vaccine to innoculate any population. (3) No laboratory had ever made a vaccine against these highly infectious, virulent & pathogenic Corona viruses of the SARS group.(4) It took some tme to decipher the RNA code and then more time to design, make and trial a vaccine, while all the time mutants were occuring, mostly not antigenicly a problem but eventually & inevitably more dangerous variants occured and will continue to occur. (5) The only way to reduce the mutation rate is to reduce the R-rate (rate of reproduction). Reducing the R-rate requires (a) self control by everyone, impossible to achieve in societies were laws can be passed but impossible to be effective where they cannot be enforced: (b)Mass supply of N95 masks of NIOSH standards, but these cost and for a multitude of reasons, mostly selfish and trivial and made wose by social media and Commercial media, a great many will not wear them properly, if at all.(c) The simple expedient of hand washing and social distancing faces the same selfish and uneducated behaviour as does mask wearing. (6) Political and commercial considerations has made  any safety measure extremely difficult, and the loosening of such measures when the R rate was falling, was disasterous, the regulations were \"easied\" at just the time when they should have been more rigorousy enforced, so we got the Yo-Yo effect, and that was avoidable if governments had the guts to stick to the basics instead of listening to party hacks in an effort to \"Give the voters what they want\" insted of what they needed. (7) in war times stringent laws were very effective when applied wihout fear of favour, not perfect by any means, but at least somwhat effective when observed. (8) The shameful behaviour of health care workers from doctors to cleaners refusing to get vacccinated or to observe sanitary regulations is not only appauling but it gives those who will not protect themselves or others an excuse, becuase \"Even doctors are not....\"  (9) If you need proof that isolation and travel restrictions work, consider this.... after 9\/11 when air travel fell, so did seasonal influenza; during the SARS epidemic in Canada, the voluntary restriction of travel and the airport and sea port surveillance was key to reducing the spread of that SARS, but this SARS-COV-2 is much more infectious and travel has played a major part in the spread. Viruses do not walk, swim or fly, thay are carried by the host victims (and if from an animal by them) and spread by contact with human activity and by the product. of human activity.

We have had clients who have questioned the  NHS certified Antiviral chemicals that we have introduced. We spoke to chemical suppliers\/ manufactures and infection control experts. All about Virus control and eradication. We have invested in Electro static and larger fogging\/ misting equipment ( not much uptake). Some Covid managers after questioning us then went to their local supermarket and brought Anti Bac spray.

That leads to another widely proliferated perception that they are all unqualified, uneducated and unskilled. That\u2019s not the case of course as I\u2019m sure you know (being in the business and in daily contact) people take on the role for a variety of reasons and therefore the motivation to do so differs vastly.

Radar altimeters can be considered as sensors for an aircraft which provide a direct measurement of the clearance height of the aircraft over the terrain or other obstaclesThere are two basic strategies to control or nullify the interference if it is applicable for RA: 1. Prevent it from coupling in the first place by using compatible filters or arc snubbers at the source, relocating equipment or rerouting cables, using signal path ground isolators or adding shielding or ferrite chokes to cables. 2. Filter out the RF, when possible, after it is coupled but before it reaches a sensitive active device in the equipment.\u2026see more","I\u2019m throwing the flag down on this. Figure it out!

Or spending the downtime and eating the cost of parking aircraft. The issue may well be crap filters in aircraft like 737s built 25 years ago.  AA has about 1,000 aircraft, and they probably don't know if any will be affected. You ever look at the electronics bay in some of these aircraft and you will find some pretty antique stuff by current standards.

If the bandwidth is too high, then the radar may no longer be used in the aircraft. That brings revenue to the aircraft industry.In the LoRaWAN frequency range, we have the same problem, but people don't talk about it so loudly.

In the Fall and Rise of China by Richard Baum, he attributes China's confucian values partly from China's geography and ready access to natural resources which allows it to be self sustainable without the need to deal with the outside world. The Chinese name for China, Zhongguo, translates to \"middle kingdom\" or \"central kingdom\" --- it reflects that China holds a China-centric view of reality, at least historically. It also holds the view that the individual's purpose is to serve the greater good, like a bee to a hive. The western world needed external resources, relied on trade and imperialism to exist and has an opposite worldview.

First one we are trying to control by imparting training to the farmers and farm workers on post harvest technology in the field which can help improvequalityand reduce substantial losses. HOWEVER, It's  very difficult to control 2nd one unless, everyone who eats decides will buy or take in plate what he\/she can eat. In one of my lecture to Food Tech students I have told them if they can develop a method to increase shelf life of left over food will be big revolution.

The gravitational force increases with the time (in million years) for the reason that the earth gradually moves nearer to the sun.

This eventually has to come to an end and finally to be merged in the sun thereby gradually increasing the gravitational force on each planets. Lets say Mercury will be the first to merge and this may increase Sun's mass (may be very little) which further lead to increase in depression and affecting the velocities of other planets.

The SINGLE photon, once emitted, will continue to travel the edge of the light cone at the speed of light.  Obviously, a star is not going to emit the \u201csame\u201d photon twice in its proper time local environment.  If it were to do that, not only is energy not conserved, but matter is not conserved (because the same fusion event would have to occur twice), but also, it would be possible to capture an infinite amount of energy by going into warp mode.2)  Even if you completely ignore this as he does, in order for the edges of orthogonal light cones to be paralell and thus meet, the spatial separation between the two has to increase.  This increases the amount of time the warp drive pilot has to wait to have the light \u201cfrom the past\u201d to arrive.3) In the light cone example where he shows Alice doing a square warp loop, he claims she\u2019s in a \u201cparallel future\u201d at the end of it.
