# FraudLink
## Misinformation Dataset for LinkedIn

To support misinformation detection research, we developed FraudLink: the first publicly available dataset that focuses on misinformation on LinkedIn. FraudLink contains over 8,000 data points from public user posts on LinkedIn spanning 35 misinformation-heavy topics in two categories: COVID-19 and Conspiracy Theories.

The dataset can be accessed in _**FraudLink.json**_.

We have also made available our LinkedIn web scraper for post search, which can be found in **_linkedin_scraper.ipynb_**. To use this scraper, first you must install chromedriver (https://chromedriver.chromium.org/getting-started). Then, simply specify a search query and run the sequence of cells. This file also contains code to clean the data.
